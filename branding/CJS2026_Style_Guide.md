## 2. Visual identity standards

### Design principles

**Distinctive, not generic**
Avoid designs that look AI-generated or template-based. CJS materials should feel crafted, professional, and authentic to the journalism industry.

**Clean and accessible**
Prioritize readability and accessibility. Use ample white space, high contrast, and clear hierarchy.

**Contemporary but not trendy**
Design should feel modern and professional without chasing fleeting trends. Materials should age well over the year leading up to the event.

**Journalism-focused aesthetic**
Design choices should reflect the professional journalism industry—credible, serious, but not stuffy or corporate.

### Layout guidelines

- Generous white space around all elements
- Clear visual hierarchy with size and weight
- Consistent margins and padding (minimum 24px for digital, 0.5" for print)
- Grid-based layouts for consistency
- Maximum 3 levels of information hierarchy per page

---

## 3. Typography and fonts

### Primary typefaces

**Montserrat** — Headlines, titles, callouts
- Bold for main titles and section headers
- Regular or Medium for subtitles and supporting headlines
- Minimum size: 18pt (print), 24px (digital)
- Use for all Summit branding materials

**Arial or sans-serif** — Body text and general content
- Regular weight for body text
- Bold for emphasis (use sparingly)
- Minimum size: 12pt (print), 16px (digital)
- Excellent for readability and accessibility

### Type hierarchy examples

```
MAIN HEADLINE — Montserrat Bold, 48px
Supporting headline — Montserrat Regular, 32px
Section header — Montserrat Bold, 24px
Body text — Arial Regular, 16px
Caption text — Arial Regular, 14px
```

### Type usage guidelines

- **Never use title case** — Always use sentence case for all headlines and titles
- **Never use all caps** — Sentence case only, even for emphasis
- **Line height**: Minimum 1.5x for body text, 1.2x for headlines
- **Line length**: Maximum 80 characters for optimal readability
- **Alignment**: Left-aligned for all text unless specific design requires otherwise
