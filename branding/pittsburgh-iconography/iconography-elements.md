# Pittsburgh iconography elements

A guide to Pittsburgh-specific visual elements for CJS2026 graphics.

---

## Tier 1: Essential elements

These should appear in the primary map illustration:

### Three Rivers confluence

**What it is:** Pittsburgh's defining geographic feature — where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers meet to form the Ohio River.

**Visual treatment:**
- Blue watercolor ribbons with visible brushstrokes
- Hand-drawn curves, not perfectly smooth
- Slightly darker blue for depth where rivers meet
- Consider teal (#2A9D8F) to match brand colors

**Importance:** Critical — this IS Pittsburgh's identity

---

### The Point (Point State Park)

**What it is:** The triangular tip of downtown Pittsburgh where the rivers converge. Home to Point State Park and its iconic fountain.

**Visual treatment:**
- Emphasized meeting point of the three rivers
- Subtle highlight in teal or gold (#C9A227)
- Small triangle shape at confluence
- Optional: tiny fountain indication

**Importance:** Critical — the heart of Pittsburgh

---

### Bridges

**What it is:** Pittsburgh has 446 bridges — more than any city in the world, including Venice. The yellow "Three Sisters" bridges are iconic.

**Visual treatment:**
- 2-4 simplified arch silhouettes crossing rivers
- Steel grey color (#6B7B8C)
- Integrated naturally into river crossings near The Point
- Arch style, not suspension

**Importance:** High — instantly signals "Pittsburgh"

---

### Hills and ridges

**What it is:** Pittsburgh is built on hills. Mt. Washington overlooks downtown, and the Allegheny Mountains run through western PA.

**Visual treatment:**
- Layered ridgeline silhouettes
- Blue-grey (#6B7B8C) with watercolor gradients
- Pencil hatching for texture
- Depth through overlapping layers

**Importance:** High — defines the terrain

---

## Tier 2: Optional/supporting elements

These can enhance the illustration but aren't required:

### Duquesne Incline

**What it is:** A historic funicular railway (cable car) on Mt. Washington, operating since 1877.

**Visual treatment:**
- Tiny incline car silhouette on hillside
- Simple geometric shape
- Could be a fun Easter egg detail

**Best for:** Adding Pittsburgh-specific charm

---

### Ruffed Grouse (Pennsylvania state bird)

**What it is:** A ground-dwelling game bird native to Pennsylvania's forests.

**Visual treatment:**
- Hand-illustrated in naturalist style
- Perched on eastern border or near Pittsburgh marker
- Brown/grey plumage with distinctive ruff
- Similar prominence to cardinal on NC map

**Best for:** Matching the NC map's bird element with PA authenticity

---

### Cathedral of Learning

**What it is:** A 42-story Late Gothic Revival tower at the University of Pittsburgh — the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere.

**Visual treatment:**
- Subtle skyline silhouette
- Gothic spire shape
- Very simplified

**Best for:** Skyline elements if including city details

---

### Mountain Laurel (Pennsylvania state flower)

**What it is:** An evergreen shrub with clusters of pink-white flowers, blooming in late spring.

**Visual treatment:**
- Small floral elements in forested areas
- Pink-white clusters
- Very subtle, background detail

**Best for:** Adding natural detail to forest areas

---

### Fort Pitt outline

**What it is:** The historic British fort that stood at The Point, namesake of Pittsburgh.

**Visual treatment:**
- Subtle star-shaped fortification outline
- Historical map style
- Very light, almost invisible

**Best for:** Historical depth, cartographic authenticity

---

### PPG Place

**What it is:** A distinctive postmodern glass "castle" in downtown Pittsburgh, designed by Philip Johnson.

**Visual treatment:**
- Simplified geometric glass towers
- Modern skyline element

**Best for:** If including modern skyline elements

---

## Tier 3: Elements to avoid

Do NOT include these elements:

| Element | Reason to avoid |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Steelers logo/colors** | Copyright, too commercial, sports divisiveness |
| **Penguins logo** | Copyright, too commercial |
| **Pirates logo** | Copyright, too commercial |
| **Black and gold color scheme** | Too associated with Steelers, clashes with brand |
| **Heinz ketchup bottle** | Corporate logo, too commercial |
| **US Steel logo** | Corporate logo |
| **Primanti Bros sandwich** | Too commercial, food reference |
| **Photorealistic skyline** | Doesn't match hand-drawn aesthetic |
| **Clean vector graphics** | Clashes with "sketch & parchment" style |
| **Generic "city" silhouette** | Not distinctive enough |
| **"Yinzer" references** | Too local/inside joke |
| **Steel mill smokestacks** | Can be done tastefully, but risks "Rust Belt decline" connotation |
