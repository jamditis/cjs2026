# Artist brief: Pennsylvania map illustration

**Project:** Collaborative Journalism Summit 2026 (CJS2026)
**Client:** Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University
**Deliverable:** Hand-illustrated map of Pennsylvania
**Budget range:** $150-400 (negotiable based on portfolio)

---

## Project overview

We need a custom illustrated map of Pennsylvania for the 2026 Collaborative Journalism Summit website. The summit is being held in Pittsburgh, PA on June 8-9, 2026, and this map will serve as a decorative background element on our homepage.

**This illustration will replace** an existing North Carolina map (see reference image) that was created for a previous venue. The new Pennsylvania map should match the style and feel of the original.

## Reference image

**See:** `nc-map-reference.png` (attached separately)

The current NC map features:
- Hand-drawn, watercolor-style illustration
- State outline filled with topographical features
- Cardinal (bird) perched on the map
- Muted, earthy color palette
- Visible brushstrokes and paper texture
- Mountains, rivers, forests, and coastal features

**Your illustration should match this aesthetic** while being authentically Pennsylvanian.

## What we need

### Primary elements (required)

1. **Pennsylvania state outline**
   - The distinctive rectangular shape with notched northwest corner (Lake Erie)
   - Hand-drawn, slightly organic edges — not vector-perfect

2. **Three Rivers confluence at Pittsburgh**
   - Allegheny + Monongahela rivers meeting to form the Ohio River
   - This is THE defining feature of Pittsburgh
   - Located in southwest corner of state
   - Should be a subtle focal point

3. **2-4 bridge silhouettes**
   - Pittsburgh is famous for having 446 bridges (more than Venice!)
   - Simple arch shapes crossing the rivers near Pittsburgh
   - Steel grey color

4. **Allegheny Mountains**
   - Running through central-western Pennsylvania
   - Blue-grey ridgelines with visible texture
   - Layered for depth

5. **Rivers throughout the state**
   - Three Rivers at Pittsburgh
   - Susquehanna River in central PA
   - Delaware River on eastern border
   - Teal/blue watercolor style

6. **Forested hills**
   - Sage green areas throughout western PA
   - Simple tree indications or watercolor wash

### Optional elements (your discretion)

- **Ruffed Grouse** (Pennsylvania state bird) — could replace the cardinal
- **Cardinal** (if you prefer brand continuity with existing CJS imagery)
- **Lake Erie** shoreline in northwest corner
- **Mountain Laurel** (PA state flower) as small details
- **Duquesne Incline** (tiny cable car on hillside) as Easter egg
