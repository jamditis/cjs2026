- Strong consistency in positive feedback

### What needs improvement

**1. Structured networking (most common request)**

**Problem:**
- Networking happened but was too spontaneous/random
- People didn't connect with local attendees
- Missed opportunities for meaningful connections

**Specific suggestions from attendees:**
- "Turn to your neighbor" moments throughout the day
- Recognition of local attendees at opening
- Facilitated networking activities
- Speed networking sessions
- Themed table discussions during meals
- Networking prompts/conversation starters

**Action for 2026:**
- Build 2-3 forced interaction moments into schedule
- Recognize local Charlotte/Raleigh attendees
- Create structured networking activities
- Assigned seating for meals to encourage new connections

**2. Speaker preparation and coaching**

**Problem:**
- Some speakers unclear about what their organization does
- Too PowerPoint-heavy without engagement
- Varied presentation quality
- Difficulty understanding actual work in short time

**Specific feedback:**

- "Need some coaching"
- "Too many PowerPoint presentations without audience engagement"

**Action for 2026:**

**Action for 2026:**

- Consider workshop elements even in presentations
- Less "telling," more "doing together"

**4. Location considerations**

**Issue raised:**
- Suburban hotel location limited spontaneous networking
- Hard to access restaurants and venues

## 4. Brand and communications standards

### Core brand elements

**Colors (never deviate)**
- Black: #000000
- Red: #CA3553
- White: #FFFFFF
- No other colors

**Typography**
- Headlines/titles: Montserrat (Bold for titles, Regular for subtitles)
- Body text: Arial or sans-serif
- Minimum sizes: 18pt headlines, 12pt body (print); 24px headlines, 16px body (digital)

**Critical rules**
- Always sentence case, never title case
- Never all caps
- Oxford comma required
- Em dashes with spaces on both sides
- Active voice preferred

### Voice and tone principles

**Professional but approachable**
- Knowledgeable colleague, not distant expert
- Serious about journalism but not stuffy

**Enthusiastic but authentic**
- Genuine excitement without hyperbole
- No empty buzzwords

**Clear and direct**
- Respect audience's time
- Get to the point quickly
- Remove unnecessary words

**Inclusive and welcoming**
- Language for all journalism professionals
- Regardless of experience level or org type

### Words and phrases to absolutely avoid

**Slop phrases (AI-generated feeling):**
- Comprehensive, robust, sophisticated, transformative
- Leverage, synergy, ecosystem, paradigm
- Very, extremely, incredibly, truly (vague intensifiers)
- "It's worth noting that", "In order to", "At the end of the day"

**Pattern to avoid:**
"Not just X—it's Y" dramatic setup

**Example of bad writing:**
"Our comprehensive suite of cutting-edge, transformative sessions leverages innovative formats to deliver a robust, holistic learning ecosystem."

**Example of good writing:**
"Lightning talks were the favorite session format at CJS2025, with 52% of attendees preferring the fast-paced, focused presentations."

### Naming conventions

**The Summit:**
- First reference: "the 2026 Collaborative Journalism Summit" or "the Collaborative Journalism Summit"
- Subsequent: "the Summit", "CJS2026", "CJS"
- Never: "the CJS2026" or "the conference"

**The Center:**
- First reference: "the Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University"
- Alternate: "the Center for Cooperative Media"
- Subsequent: "the Center"
- Internal only: "CCM" (never external)

**People:**
- First reference: Full name (Jane Doe)
- Subsequent: Last name (Doe)
- Exception: Casual contexts or multiple people with same last name

### Social media hashtags

**Primary (always use):**
- #CJS2026

**Secondary (max 3 per post):**
- #collaborativejournalism
- #journalismcollaboration
- #localnews
- #journalism
- #nonprofitnews (for INN partnership)

**Potential 2026 specific:**
- #CJS10years (anniversary)
- #CJSlightningtalks
- #CJSCharlotte or #CJSRaleigh

### Accessibility requirements (non-negotiable)

**All materials must:**
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Include alt text for all images
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text
- Work with screen readers
- Use descriptive link text (never "click here")

**Alt text examples:**

❌ Poor: "People at conference"
✅ Good: "Three journalists reviewing printed collaborative reporting guidelines at a conference table"

❌ Poor: "Graph"
✅ Good: "Bar graph showing 52% of attendees preferred lightning talks, 30% preferred plenary sessions, and 18% preferred concurrent sessions"

## 5. Event format evolution

### Traditional format (2017-2025)

**Two full days:**

**Strengths:**

**Reporting approach:**
- Comprehensive analysis (like CJS2025 post-event report)
- Key metrics and insights
- Actionable recommendations
- Share with stakeholders and sponsors

### Content distribution

**Ongoing challenge:**
- No perfect system for distributing collaborative content
- Various approaches: AP StoryShare, Distributed Media Lab, Google Drive, email
- Still an issue after 10+ years of attempts
- Consider for panel/discussion at Summit

**Creative Commons and republishing:**
- Many orgs offer free republishing
- Lack of consistency in guidelines
- No central clearinghouse
- Opportunity for improvement in field

## 14. Decision-making frameworks

### When planning sessions

**Ask these questions:**
1. Does this provide clear, actionable value?
2. Will this speaker engage the audience (not just lecture)?
3. Does this represent diverse perspectives?
4. Is this appropriate for the experience level mix?
5. Does this balance with other session types?
6. Will people remember this in 3 months?

**Red flags:**
- Too promotional (selling vs. teaching)
- Overly academic (theory vs. practice)
- Unclear takeaways
- No interaction planned
- Speaker untested/unproven

### When evaluating venue options

**Criteria to consider:**
1. Accessibility (ADA compliance, transportation)
2. Walkability (restaurants, downtown access)
3. Meeting space quality and flexibility
4. Food and beverage capabilities
5. Cost and budget fit
6. Local collaborative journalism scene
7. Airport accessibility
8. Hotel room costs for attendees

**Charlotte advantages:**
- Knight Foundation presence
- Charlotte Journalism Collaborative
- Betsy Abraham local contact
- Hotels near downtown, 15 min from airport
- Strong local connections

**Raleigh advantages:**
- Strong downtown
- Public transit
- Public radio presence
- RDU area has good infrastructure

### When considering format changes

**Questions to ask:**
1. What problem does this solve?
2. What evidence supports this change?
3. What are the trade-offs?
4. How will community react?
5. What's the risk if it doesn't work?
6. Can we test this first?
7. What feedback supports this?

**2026 format changes rationale:**
- Conference fatigue documented
- Budget constraints for attendees
- Quality over quantity preference
- Survey feedback supports changes
- Maintains core strengths (lightning talks)

### When writing content

**Before publishing, check:**
1. Is this sentence case? (not Title Case)
2. Did I use Oxford commas?
3. Is this active voice?
4. Did I include alt text for images?
5. Are contrast ratios sufficient?
6. Is this clear and concise?
7. Did I avoid slop phrases?
8. Would I say this to a colleague?

**If answer is no to any, revise.**

### When engaging with community

**Communication principles:**
1. Be transparent about challenges
2. Ask for input on major decisions
3. Acknowledge feedback and act on it
4. Show, don't just tell
5. Follow through on commitments
6. Admit mistakes and learn
7. Celebrate community wins

**Warning signs you're off track:**
- Community seems disengaged
- Negative feedback patterns
- Declining registration
- Speaker recruitment difficulties
- Sponsor challenges
- Internal team stress

### When evaluating success

**Quantitative metrics:**
- Registration numbers
- Survey response rate
- Satisfaction scores
- Session attendance
- Social media engagement
- Sponsorship revenue

**Qualitative indicators:**
- Community enthusiasm
- Unsolicited positive feedback
- Repeat attendance
- Speaker interest
- Media coverage
- Partnership opportunities
- Field impact and citations

**Don't just look at numbers:**
- One disappointed attendee (4%) is still valuable feedback
- High satisfaction doesn't mean no improvement needed
- Look for patterns in qualitative feedback
- Consider long-term community health
