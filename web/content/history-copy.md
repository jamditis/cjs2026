A decade of working together

### Subhead
The 2026 Collaborative Journalism Summit marks 10 years of bringing journalists, funders, and media leaders together to build a more collaborative future for news.

### Intro paragraph
What started in 2017 as an experiment — could newsrooms actually work together? — has grown into a movement. From ethnic media partnerships in Montclair to global investigative networks that toppled world leaders, the Collaborative Journalism Summit has chronicled and catalyzed a transformation in how journalism gets done.

Over 10 summits in 8 cities, we've watched collaborative journalism evolve from a novel idea to standard practice. Here's how we got here.

## Year-by-year summaries

### 2017 — Montclair, NJ
**The beginning**

170 journalists gathered for the first-ever Collaborative Journalism Summit. The question on everyone's mind: can newsrooms really work together? That day, we launched our first open funding call with three $7,000 grants. The answer was yes.

*"Working together in the public interest can achieve greater results than working alone in our own interests."* — Stefanie Murray

---

### 2018 — Montclair, NJ
**Building bridges**

The second summit focused on partnerships between mainstream and ethnic media outlets. Daniela Gerson's keynote on ethnic media collaborations set the tone. We introduced lightning talks — a format that's become a summit signature. Projects like Documenting Hate showed what cross-newsroom collaboration could achieve.

---

### 2019 — Philadelphia, PA
**People over projects**

In the city of Broke in Philly, we grappled with equity and inclusion in collaborative journalism. Sessions tackled blind spots in newsroom collaborations and how partnerships can change racial narratives in media. The question shifted from "how do we collaborate?" to "who gets to be part of this?"

---

### 2020 — Virtual
**Adapting together**

We had planned to be in Charlotte. Then COVID changed everything. The pandemic became the ultimate test of collaborative journalism — and the field rose to meet it. Free virtual registration made the summit accessible to anyone, anywhere. Newsrooms across the country teamed up to cover the biggest story of our lifetime.

---

### 2021 — Virtual
**Removing barriers**

A second virtual year brought innovations we've kept: tiered pricing based on ability to pay, scholarships for those who need them, and a format that welcomed global participation. We even added collaborative meditation breaks. Sometimes adaptation creates something better.

---

### 2022 — Chicago, IL
**Building to last**

In the city of City Bureau and Solving for Chicago, we asked: how do collaboratives survive long-term? The answer came down to one word: trust. "Trust is confidence in the face of risk that the other person will do the right thing." Growth takes time. Strong scaffolding ensures sustainability.

---

### 2023 — Washington, D.C.
**Building frameworks**

In the nation's capital, we launched a working group on collaborative journalism policies. The summit had matured from sharing tactics to building infrastructure. We introduced session categories — Strategies, Tactics, Tools — to help attendees find what they needed.

---

### 2024 — Detroit, MI
**Global impact**

Gerard Ryle, director of ICIJ, brought stories of the Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, and Pandora Papers — collaborations that toppled four world leaders. Collaborative journalism wasn't just a nice idea anymore. It was reshaping the world.

---

### 2025 — Denver, CO
**Partnerships with purpose**

200 journalists gathered in Colorado — where 180+ outlets already work together, making the state a "national laboratory for collaborative journalism." MLK50 showed what community impact looks like: $12 million in medical debt erased. "Collaboration is like a marriage," said Laura Frank. It takes commitment.

---

### 2026 — Chapel Hill, NC
**The next chapter**

Ten years after we first asked "can we do this?", we return to North Carolina — the state we'd planned to visit in 2020 before COVID intervened. Full circle. At UNC's Friday Center, we'll celebrate a decade of working together and chart the course for the next ten years.

The pandemic forced a pivot — and revealed how resilient collaborative journalism had become. COVID coverage became the ultimate test case. Virtual formats opened doors we hadn't known were closed.

### 2022-2023: "How do we sustain this?"
The sustainability era. Collaboratives that had proven they could start now needed to prove they could last. Trust, governance, and policy frameworks took center stage.
