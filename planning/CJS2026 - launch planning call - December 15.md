[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=0.0) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
things. Was that TikTok I sent you last night not hilarious? Oh, my God. I did not know where that was going.

[@0:07](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=7.38) \- Stefanie Murray  
And all of a was like, did you send that to Denise? Did Denise see that?

[@0:12](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=12.5) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
No, I didn't.

[@0:13](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=13.06) \- Stefanie Murray  
But I went back through her TikToks, and I think it's true.

[@0:16](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=16.06) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I think that's a true story. Her brother did that. it's real? Okay. Oh, my God. She's a comedian, though.

[@0:22](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=22.0) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[@0:23](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=23.22) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I think I've seen her before somewhere, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Can imagine?

[@0:27](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=27.22) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, no.

[@0:29](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=29.46) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, my God.

[@0:30](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=30.62) \- Stefanie Murray  
I'm glad she processes things in a healthy way, I guess. All right. I was just talking about Denise, but it's funny.  
TikTok I sent Joe last night. And this woman who's a comedian, she was talking about how her brother died.  
Okay. And so she decided to put a joint in his coffin as a send-off. I want somebody to do that for me, but I want to have an open casket.

[@0:56](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=56.26) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I'll note it.

[@0:57](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=57.84) \- Denise Shannon  
Wait, you want an open casket, or are you good?

[@0:59](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=59.34) \- Stefanie Murray  
I don't want one.

[@1:00](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=60.0) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
But find a way to smuggle weed into the crematorium so that I get blazed up with it, you know?  
Figure it out, right, yeah.

[@1:06](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=66.44) \- Stefanie Murray  
Make sure your brothers know that. And so she, like, after the viewing, she went, before the church ceremony, she went in there and put it, like, inside his hat.

[@1:17](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=77.84) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah. And then closed the casket, and then they did the service, and she didn't realize that the casket was going to be reopened at the service.

[@1:27](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=87.26) \- Stefanie Murray  
And they reopened the casket, and it stank so strong because it had been in the closed space for, like, two hours.  
did.

[@1:36](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=96.54) \- Denise Shannon  
With a decomposing body. Isn't that horrific?

[@1:42](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=102.68) \- Stefanie Murray  
But it was really funny the way she told the story.

[@1:44](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=104.52) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, it sounds really dark the way, when you say it like that, but the way that she described it, it's so funny.  
She's just, like, in her room, in her bed, just like, I did not realize how this was going to get out of hand.

[@1:55](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=115.36) \- Stefanie Murray  
Anyway.

[@1:56](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=116.94) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I have.

[@1:57](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=117.96) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yes, I needed. Funny TikToks last night. Because you guys, now William has a facial tick.

[@2:04](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=124.98) \- Denise Shannon  
What? you mean?

[@2:07](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=127.14) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Like a...

[@2:07](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=127.9) \- Stefanie Murray  
Which is a classic sign.

[@2:10](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=130.54) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yes, classic sign of rheumatic fever. No , I have so many of those. I've had so many of those throughout my life, they change.

[@2:18](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=138.2) \- Stefanie Murray  
He definitely has rheumatic fever. And the pediatrician, she just called me back. She's like, he doesn't have rheumatic fever, Stefanie.  
He had antibiotics for a month and a half. We treated his infection because the pediatrician feels bad because they treated his original strep infection, but he still got rheumatic fever.  
So I know that's why. And I was like, Dr. Batra, I mean, we're waiting to hear from the rheumatologist who's out till tomorrow.  
But, yeah. So all weekend, he's like this.

[@2:44](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=164.94) \- Denise Shannon  
Oh, my God. baby.

[@2:47](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=167.3) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
notices it.

[@2:48](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=168.06) \- Stefanie Murray  
And he goes like this. He tries to... Oh, man.

[@2:51](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=171.18) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
To make it go away.

[@2:52](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=172.56) \- Denise Shannon  
And then he had to go to school with it that way today. Yes.

[@2:55](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=175.48) \- Stefanie Murray  
Emailed his teacher this morning. And I was like, just so you know, he's got this facial tick. He said, don't worry about it.  
But it's been like, I've been so anxious about it all day long because I think he's, I think he has rheumatic fever.  
Why does my Zoom keep changing the size of my head?

[@3:13](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=193.04) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, you have auto frame on or auto reframe.

[@3:15](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=195.98) \- Stefanie Murray  
I think they automatically enable that . your eyebrows on too, too? Yes.

[@3:21](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=201.68) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. I do too.

[@3:22](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=202.76) \- Stefanie Murray  
No, I mean, do you have your Zoom eyebrows on?

[@3:25](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=205.1) \- Denise Shannon  
No. Are you sure? I took them off. Okay. They're off now.

[@3:29](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=209.28) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. Cause mine are on still. I keep mine on. Oh no, they turned mine off. What the hell? There we But I don't know why I've got any kind of auto frame.  
They just added it recently. It is under appearance on video. And if do auto framing, it does that. And then if you move.  
Oh, look, my eyebrows got crazy. They're my special eyebrows.

[@3:54](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=234.02) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. That makes sense.

[@3:55](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=235.74) \- Stefanie Murray  
The eyebrows sometimes for people like you, Joe, with the glasses, it's not that. For people like you, Denise, sometimes when the eyebrows are on, they are.

[@4:04](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=244.18) \- Denise Shannon  
Well, that's what those were way too dark today. Yes.

[@4:09](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=249.0) \- Stefanie Murray  
Wait, you disappeared now. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Also, I'm dreading my, oh, that's the doctor.  
Hold on. I'll be right back.

[@4:25](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=265.44) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay, Denise, while she's doing that, let's go through the air table, I the event, right, and see if we can at least get the bones of what you need set up.  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=272.527675)  
So we obviously, we still have to update all of this kind of stuff. That's, that's pretty easy. But I did go ahead and add an add on.

[@4:42](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=282.9) \- Denise Shannon  
I like the way you changed the mountains. Oh, good.

[@4:45](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=285.88) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay, yeah, I went back and forth.

[@4:47](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=287.18) \- Denise Shannon  
I mean, not that my opinion matters. It does.

[@4:50](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=290.48) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
It does. It looked like it was all ocean, and I didn't like my little honeysuckles, so I got rid of the honeysuckles.  
I kept them, but I got the coastal plains and the peaks. Mont represented a little better. This one felt too much like a map, although I do love seeing 95 go through here.  
This one felt like winter.

[@5:07](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=307.48) \- Denise Shannon  
like the topography. I just don't want it to look like it's snowing so much.

[@5:11](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=311.64) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, I could probably remove the snow-capped mountains because I don't, I mean, they technically do get those, but.

[@5:17](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=317.76) \- Denise Shannon  
Right. No, there's one that looked like more snowy.

[@5:21](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=321.56) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
This is terrifying. tried to have an AI turn this into something and it put like a crazy man's face or whatever you want to see there.  
Oh, yes, I see him.

[@5:31](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=331.2) \- Denise Shannon  
Let's see, where are we?

[@5:32](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=332.56) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay, so tickets.

[@5:34](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=334.02) \- Denise Shannon  
I have a thought real quick before you get into like a whole bunch of finagling.

[@5:39](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=339.92) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah.

[@5:40](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=340.52) \- Denise Shannon  
What if we only had an event, like you just copy this and you make an event that's for me and it only has, can you do that?  
That only has. Oh, like a, like an unlisted one where we can send them the link to register for the dinner specifically.  
We can absolutely. Absolutely do that.

[@6:00](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=360.84) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

[@6:02](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=362.16) \- Denise Shannon  
Would that make it easier than trying?

[@6:03](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=363.98) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I mean, I mean, it certainly would make it make sure that it worked exactly the way we wanted it to.  
So if you're OK with like dealing with the fact that, you know, that any extra link or anything like that, but I can also track all of that.  
I can also make all that automated automatically tracked, you know, so we can do it that way. I think what's really holding us back is we need to figure out our own or like a global payment system that like Stripe or something that allows us to charge for things without having to go through a third party, you know, a vendor for each thing.  
I don't think that that would be crazy to set up and we could still we could still use Eventbrite to.  
Well, we could eventually move away from Eventbrite. Right. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to use figure out how I can use Firebase, which is from Google, their database system and to move us off of some of these third.  
The biggest value.

[@7:00](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=420.0) \- Denise Shannon  
We take any percentage. We would just have to pay a percentage credit Stripe does.

[@7:04](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=424.46) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I know that any of those independent vendor pay things where they have them at craft fairs and you can do scan.  
ACTION ITEM: Research Stripe/Firebase payment fees/options vs Eventbrite \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=426.9999)  
They charge typical credit card processing fees, I don't know what that fee is, and I don't know the details.  
I can ask, and I can do a little digging to find out what that would look like, but I don't think it's going to be as much as Eventbrite.  
And the biggest value of Eventbrite, other than the fact that it's already built in and it works mostly, and they have that internal promotion ecosystem and the connection with Facebook, whatever.  
But the biggest thing is the abstraction, is the ability to just click and drag things. Everybody can use it and that kind of stuff.  
But if I can recreate some very basic, very simple, not complex components of this that would allow us to rely at least a little bit less on something like this, especially when we have these kind of custom, you know, special things here, I'll give that a shot.  
No, I totally agree.

[@7:58](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=478.5) \- Denise Shannon  
I'd love for us to be able

[@8:01](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=481.98) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
My only concern there that I want to be very aware of and conscious of is that even from that sponsorship package tool, when there's a bug and it doesn't work, there's nobody to call and say, hey, Eventbrite, it's not working.  
It's just me. So I don't want to get us in a situation where I get all eager and excited because I built a simple tool that works and then, you know, it just, our infrastructure collapses.  
doesn't. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to stick, I want to start with things that are very concrete and core that we know will work every time, you know, blah, blah, blah.  
Yeah. Okay. So I set the register for the summit at $199.99. As we discussed, sales start today, technically, and they end the Friday before the summit.  
Do you want to push that back to like Monday, Tuesday?

[@8:50](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=530.76) \- Denise Shannon  
I mean, I'm definitely going to have to lock in earlier with the Friday center. There are going to be a pain in the .

[@8:58](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=538.44) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay. So I'll just push this to that. To Monday for now. we can adjust that later. It's not a big deal.  
The register for the summit ticket is hidden until the early bird at 129\. I just threw a random number in there.  
felt like 130 is, I was assuming we're going to do 150 this year. So I did 130, but we can make this more, we can do 150, you know, if you're worried about that or whatever.  
The number itself is not a huge concern. It's just that I have this expiring on, wait, no, I have the early bird registration expiring on February 25th.  
And then why February 25th? Wait a minute. Why February 25th?

[@9:39](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=579.901) \- Denise Shannon  
Is that a certain number of days? No, it should be the 28th.

[@9:43](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=583.621) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
don't what, wait a minute. Sales start, sales end 28th. Wait, am I insane? Did I, did it not just say February 25th here?  
Or was I looking at these two numbers? Anyway, it ends February 25th and then, or 28th. And then the register for the summit will appear.  
That same time, one minute afterwards. So it'll go from early bird to register, you know, general admission. The speaker.

[@10:08](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=608.081) \- Denise Shannon  
we still have, so I guess we have to come up with, so are we going to do a dinner bundle?

[@10:17](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=617.781) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Right now, this is what it looks of early bird? I figured we would charge the same for the, for the dinner add-on.  
No, we definitely can't.

[@10:30](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=630.001) \- Denise Shannon  
I mean, right now, I'm not, I'm not exaggerating when I say 200 is our breakeven point just for the menu.

[@10:38](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=638.561) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
$200 for each registration, you're saying? Yeah. Okay, so it needs to be maybe 75, maybe $100 for the dinner?

[@10:46](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=646.421) \- Denise Shannon  
And then you will put the dinner on top of it, which you can do very little for 50, but I'm trying to, like, make it completely unaffordable.  
Yeah, I set the dinner add-on price at 60 bucks.

[@10:59](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=659.341) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Perhaps we could change. And I'm not absorbing the fees. So it's, it ends up being like $67 for them.

[@11:07](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=667.061) \- Denise Shannon  
We can go up.

[@11:08](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=668.081) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
mean, 75 seems like a, you know, if we pitch it like our 10th anniversary and maybe make it a dinner slash fundraiser kind of a thing, that would justify some of those elevated prices.  
And then we can offer, you know, certain sponsors. Yeah. Huh?

[@11:24](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=684.281) \- Stefanie Murray  
I hope we can get a dinner sponsor soon. Yeah.

[@11:26](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=686.921) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I hope we can get a dinner sponsor. Yeah. We're assuming, assuming worst case, assuming worst case that we don't get a dinner sponsor, we can still jack up the price of the dinner a little bit as the add-on in the spirit of, you know, raising some extra funding or doing like that.  
I mean, even if it's just raising money to pay for the summit itself, but we don't have to go into details.

[@11:47](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=707.601) \- Stefanie Murray  
want to be careful with that just because. Right.

[@11:50](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=710.621) \- Denise Shannon  
I think the wording has to be really, yeah.

[@11:53](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=713.261) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. Right. I'm sure there are some kind of legal concerns or issues we have to make sure. No, but like if cat is going to be.

[@12:00](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=720.001) \- Denise Shannon  
A sponsor.

[@12:01](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=721.601) \- Stefanie Murray  
She's in Europe right now, which why she hasn't answered me.

[@12:04](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=724.421) \- Denise Shannon  
She could legitimately say, well, why are you charging X for the dinner if we're sponsoring it? I mean, it's going to be $100 a person, I think, is a very realistic estimate.  
So on 150 people, that's a lot.

[@12:24](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=744.361) \- Stefanie Murray  
Should we rethink the dinner? We might have to. Of course, that was a rheumatologist, and they don't think there's anything that they can do for him.  
And now they want me to go back to the pediatrician and now try to get him referred to neurology.  
Jesus Christ. like, I was in tears. I just, I think he has rheumatic fever, and no one believes me.  
They're like, he can't. He doesn't have, he got treated. I'm like, he has every symptom. Every symptom.

[@13:00](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=780.001) \- Denise Shannon  
Every symptom he has.

[@13:03](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=783.221) \- Stefanie Murray  
Seriously. And she's like, well, even tics aren't always part of rheumatic fever. And I was like, lady, do you know how many papers I read last night on the NIH?  
Tics are very common.

[@13:15](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=795.741) \- Denise Shannon  
And what explanation would there be for all of a sudden for him to, what other condition presents that way?  
Like with no other symptoms.

[@13:28](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=808.421) \- Stefanie Murray  
He had strep, he had migrating joint pain in a counterclockwise fashion, and he has a facial tick. Those are three classic parts of rheumatic fever.  
So what are they going to think that is going to be diagnosed differently?

[@13:45](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=825.081) \- Denise Shannon  
Of those three things, what other physical condition could that be?

[@13:53](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=833.921) \- Stefanie Murray  
All right.

[@13:54](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=834.781) \- Denise Shannon  
Sorry, I'm getting off track.

[@13:56](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=836.161) \- Stefanie Murray  
So, so, okay. So. Let's rethink this a little bit.

[@14:01](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=841.721) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
That's not good.

[@14:06](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=846.741) \- Denise Shannon  
I would rather not have an add-on at all made available to attendees. I think it should be a bundle price for the whole event if we're going to do something special at night.  
And I am worried about you putting in these early bird numbers that are way below our cost.

[@14:30](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=870.661) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, I hear you. Those are not locked in. I just wanted to have something because I needed a link for the button.

[@14:38](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=878.861) \- Denise Shannon  
Stephanie, while you were on the phone, what I was just saying to Joe is what if we had, again, just from an administrative perspective, what if we had a dinner event that he just, he quickly duplicates this dinner event, it's a private event, the only way it gets used is me.  
Me providing it to somebody who, like, begs to be added after they've gone through reservations. Because that's the only way we're going to capture money.  
I think add-ons get people confused because they, you know, the bottom line doesn't come up in the beginning. But I want to have the ability to still, because we can't just, like, do a bunch of free tickets either.  
You mean for people who decide?

[@15:25](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=925.961) \- Stefanie Murray  
Right. They register without the dinner. And then they're like, oh, actually, I do want to come.

[@15:31](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=931.621) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah.

[@15:33](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=933.561) \- Stefanie Murray  
So here's another idea. Instead of doing a dinner, a sit-down nice dinner, what if, like, for $15,000, I wonder if we could do something that's more fun and economical.  
Right.

[@15:50](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=950.381) \- Denise Shannon  
mean, you know, the Detroit Museum event, everybody loved. I mean, we wasted money on food, but we came into $10,000.  
We're just going. Yeah, there is like I already reached out to the Botanical Garden. Their space is incredible. Of course, they have an event already booked on Monday night.  
But there's also within a very close distance to the hotel is they have a there's a planetarium and you can do cool nighttime things at the planetarium.

[@16:26](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=986.881) \- Stefanie Murray  
Mm hmm.

[@16:28](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=988.561) \- Denise Shannon  
What you think? What do you think about doing some kind of reception?

[@16:33](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=993.321) \- Stefanie Murray  
Totally.

[@16:34](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=994.221) \- Denise Shannon  
That is awesome.

[@16:35](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=995.921) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I love that idea.

[@16:39](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=999.261) \- Stefanie Murray  
OK, let's just blow it wide open. And if we're not going to do a nice dinner. Let's do something else.  
Yeah.

[@16:51](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1011.34) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, because they have they basically can customize the experience for exactly what we want people to.

[@17:00](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1020.0) \- Stefanie Murray  
The planetarium people? Yeah.

[@17:02](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1022.62) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@17:03](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1023.84) \- Stefanie Murray  
All let's do it. Okay.

[@17:10](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1030.1) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, because that, you know, unless they say, like, you have to run out the entire museum, I don't see any reason why I couldn't come in under 10 for that.

[@17:22](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1042.5) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, yeah.  
ACTION ITEM: Email Moorhead Planetarium re: Mon evening reception; request availability/options/pricing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1046.9999)

[@17:27](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1047.34) \- Denise Shannon  
And still, you know.

[@17:28](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1048.9) \- Stefanie Murray  
And do you think that they have availability? Well, I didn't.

[@17:37](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1057.46) \- Denise Shannon  
I can reach out today for sure. yeah, yeah.

[@17:40](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1060.32) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. All right, so let's blow it wide open and see what else we can do on Monday evening. We'll still plan for a Monday afternoon, Monday evening, and then Tuesday wrap up.

[@17:49](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1069.8) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@17:57](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1077.56) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They said, private...

[@18:00](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1080.0) \- Denise Shannon  
Show, Private Stage Demonstration, Private Exhibit Experience, Keynote Speaker from the Moorhead Planetarium or Science Education Team, or Customize the Experience Entirely.  
This is built into the Facility Use Reservation with no additional charge, so. All right, I'll put that out.

[@18:28](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1108.24) \- Stefanie Murray  
What, though, do we do about the add-on? Like, I guess I don't understand what this is for if it's not for this exact purpose that we're doing.

[@18:40](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1120.3) \- Denise Shannon  
All right, I didn't follow. I don't follow what you do. I don't understand, like, what the hell is an add-on for an Eventbrite if it doesn't work for this, to add an event onto your event?  
Like, what is it for? Right. I don't get it.

[@18:53](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1133.42) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
It's for things like VIP parking or, I mean, it's exactly what it's for, but the problem is managing it.  
like Italy. looksad. All You're And restricting it to a certain group of people or a set of tickets, they don't seem to have the tools to let you be more restrictive like this, which having an unlisted separate Eventbrite listing for the dinner that we send to people once they've registered and they like to also sign up for the dinner, it does create more user friction or whatever, but it allows us to do a little bit more customization and restriction and targeted outreach rather than just having anybody who wants to buy a ticket can also sign up for the dinner.  
I do think it makes sense to use an add-on to just let people pay whatever for the dinner. You know, if they want to pay an extra $75 or extra $100 for the dinner, they can.  
And then we can decide when they inevitably email us asking if they can get a cheaper ticket. You know, that we could say yes or no, but.  
And then most people will just go out and do their own.

[@20:04](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1204.0) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, mean, there's a ton of stuff that is around where we're going to be. Not that I'm, you know, I don't want to be excluding anyone based on price.  
I think it just needs to be. What if we just get rid of this entirely?

[@20:24](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1224.64) \- Stefanie Murray  
And this is just the conference. It's an afternoon, a keynote, lightning talk session, event, Tuesday. That's it. It's all one price.  
You're coming. Mm-hmm.

[@20:38](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1238.24) \- Denise Shannon  
What, no, no dinner?

[@20:40](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1240.08) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Or the dinners included, you mean? Yes. What if we don't get But it's over, it's a higher price for everyone, you're saying?  
sign up for the conference and you come to the event.

[@20:49](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1249.44) \- Denise Shannon  
Well, that's, well, that gets back to our issue of deterring people from We're still capturing the revenue. Well, that, but that returns us to our main issue with the price in the first place is that we weren't, we were.

[@21:00](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1260.0) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
We worried that it was deterring ticket sales and reducing ticket sales because it was too expensive. So we're trying to balance, you know, getting people in the door for a hunt for 150 and maybe, you know, 70 more people for 220 or whatever, or 250 versus getting only a certain number of people at 250 to begin with.  
Right. So that's the decision we have to make, whether or not we think that that's a valuable tradeoff and that it will, we'll still get enough signups if we force everybody to do 220 or 250 or whatever.

[@21:30](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1290.32) \- Denise Shannon  
You know, I think part of the problem with last year and why we, you know, ended up discounting 65% of, or 64% of our tickets was the destination.

[@21:43](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1303.94) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. You know, now we're on the East coast.

[@21:48](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1308.14) \- Denise Shannon  
It's not, you know, it's still a financial commitment that someone's making to come, but I don't think they're going to incur the kind of travel expenses.  
Or the majority won't incur the kind of travel expenses that you had to to fly to Denver. So I don't think we have to go as high, but I think it has to be higher than, you know, bucks.

[@22:16](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1336.24) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yes.

[@22:17](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1337.1) \- Denise Shannon  
I think that's too, too, too low. And if it's not going to be a sit-down dinner, if it's going to be, you know, a cool event.  
Yeah.

[@22:41](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1361.02) \- Stefanie Murray  
The issue with the cool event is just that some people might not show up, but it's like I just got to, like, figure out a way to, like, do it, you know, so that it is, like, so that we have an event people want to come to.

[@22:56](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1376.94) \- Denise Shannon  
Right. Right. We need to get Bill Nye to come to the planetarium and speak. Yeah, we'll get Neil.

[@23:05](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1385.42) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Get Neil and Bill. I have until 1.30. Just so you know, did you want to spend a few, a minute real quick going over there?  
Let's look at the website.

[@23:24](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1404.46) \- Stefanie Murray  
I can jump back on again between two and three.

[@23:27](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1407.06) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Denise and I are back on it too.

[@23:28](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1408.74) \- Stefanie Murray  
mean.

[@23:28](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1408.92) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay, so I'll jump in with you guys. I I want to step back and I'd be able to think about like, okay, nothing's set in stone here.

[@23:35](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1415.56) \- Stefanie Murray  
Right. We can make this whatever we want to make it. Totally. Make it fun and inviting.

[@23:42](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1422.56) \- Denise Shannon  
Right. And expensive as hell. Well, that's what, like, I was thinking about some of the stuff that, you know, it's not apples to apples, but I was thinking about some of the cool stuff when I was reading Catherine's itinerary for that super expensive.  
expensive. defensive. So Thank conference that she went to that was like $2,500. Yes, we can't, you know, promise those kinds of experiences, but what can we do that's like really different than anything that we've ever done?  
Yeah. So, if you want go through the event, right, and we'll spend a little bit more time thinking about the money piece.  
Let's paint a mural together. We also, one thought before I jump off in a few minutes.

[@24:41](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1481.16) \- Stefanie Murray  
Wait, Joe, want to look at the website, and then Denise and I are going to continue this conversation.

[@24:45](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1485.34) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
All all right, so. going with your thought. I was just going to say, it'd be cool if somebody else could like sponsor a ticket for some, you know, some rich people could sponsor a ticket for, you know, another person or whatever to help.  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1488.963022)  
So instead of giving it free. that's what sponsors do in part. Yeah, no, I know, but individual sponsors, you know, like, you know, pay it forward kind of a thing.  
Yeah.

[@25:05](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1505.42) \- Stefanie Murray  
Oh, I see what saying.

[@25:07](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1507.46) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, like we, you know, help pay for someone else's ticket. We have, you know, this many people who want reduced price, so we need to hit this many, blah, blah, blah.  
That's getting more complicated, though. Okay. Okay, let me log into the, okay.

[@25:20](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1520.4) \- Stefanie Murray  
So let me, I'm, let just share my screen. Let me share my screen so I can show you what I'm doing.

[@25:26](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1526.82) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. And where did, where does this thing, your work, I know you told me, but I don't remember. Where does this thing live?

[@25:35](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1535.74) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
It's in Airtable, in the Airtable base under site content.

[@25:40](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1540.06) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@25:40](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1540.98) \- Stefanie Murray  
But there's a lot of stuff I don't see, so can I share my screen? Yes, you can.

[@25:45](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1545.12) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay, thank you.  
SCREEN SHARING: Stefanie started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1549.978701)

[@25:46](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1546.18) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. Okay, so I'm here. So I'm first just looking at this page, the homepage, right? The homepage, yep.

[@25:55](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1555.92) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay. And I'm like, this looks good.

[@25:57](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1557.66) \- Stefanie Murray  
That's correct. Eight, nine, 10th anniversary. Anniversary. I'll check that in a minute. Save the date. I read this. This is great.  
Yep.

[@26:06](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1566.1) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Here. Okay.

[@26:07](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1567.28) \- Stefanie Murray  
So, so this finally changed. So earlier when I updated it in here, it did not change. And I even waited like 20 minutes and it didn't change after I hit update.  
So how did you get that to update?

[@26:22](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1582.36) \- Denise Shannon  
Hmm.

[@26:25](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1585.72) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, oh, like earlier today, earlier today. Yeah. When you said, when you said you didn't see stuff, I went in and I had to make sure I had to make sure all the, the stuff in Airtable was, was correctly pointed to it.  
And as I'm making changes, I have a new, a new rule that will automatically update Airtable's fields, like the available stuff to change with any of the new stuff that appears on the site.

[@26:47](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1607.02) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. Cause I, cause I was hitting, I was hitting update.

[@26:50](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1610.98) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yep. Nothing was updating.

[@26:52](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1612.92) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yep.

[@26:53](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1613.68) \- Denise Shannon  
So that's fixed.

[@26:54](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1614.74) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. Yeah.

[@26:55](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1615.42) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
So it usually takes anywhere from like 30 to 30 seconds to three minutes for the change. just go live and then you just hard refresh and you should see it.

[@27:03](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1623.18) \- Stefanie Murray  
So now it's working. Okay, great. Yeah.

[@27:05](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1625.12) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Now it was working before.

[@27:06](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1626.74) \- Stefanie Murray  
just, there was something, there were some duplicates that were getting messed up that I forgot to clean out. So we're good.  
Okay. So then I don't know where to find this. I didn't see this anywhere.

[@27:21](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1641.16) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Go to the air table. There's two ways can do this. First of all, click the little grid view to move that sidebar out of the way.

[@27:28](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1648.42) \- Stefanie Murray  
sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[@27:30](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1650.72) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I've added back the second column, which is name, which is the name of like the plain version name of what you're changing.  
So instead of just those like ID tags. And one way you could do that is to command F and search for a specific phrase and it should bring you to that.  
So if you search for Monday main summit or main summit, that should jump you right to that. Curated. Curated.  
Oh, so it's in section.

[@27:53](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1673.8) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah.

[@27:54](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1674.26) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
So it's broken down by page and then each section has its own thing. So you see section history, section thing.  
If you grow all the way up. I'll says page, and you can collapse and expand those.

[@28:03](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1683.02) \- Stefanie Murray  
fine. So I was just looking for it on the home page.

[@28:05](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1685.82) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. So you can collapse all of those and then just open, expand the page and then the section you want to edit so that it's a little less overwhelming.

[@28:13](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1693.6) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. Okay. That's where I'm, okay. Yeah.

[@28:18](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1698.88) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
All right. I also made a user guide for you just in case you get lost so that it breaks down everything that, how all that works.

[@28:33](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1713.5) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. So now I see. Okay. So now I can keep going because that was my problem is I didn't see it and then I didn't, I did not scroll all the way to the bottom there.

[@28:40](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1720.88) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. And then the other thing is the schedule tab in Airtable, that is now live, pulling live from the schedule tab and will be what is displayed on the schedule page for the site.  
So no more. Okay. You know, more making like copying and pasting it over to the CMS, like what we put on the schedule page.  
ACTION ITEM: Update Airtable Schedule: mark Public sessions; replace samples w/ TBAs \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1742.9999)  
And when we click, you know, public, when it's checked, that is the session for that block. So that will be the live page.  
So right now, if you notice, the schedule page has all of our like, should we get this person? Should we get this?  
You know, whatever. Like it has our sample sessions in there. So we will, we can go through and make those more generic TBAs, or we can, you know, lock in, you know, make them more like, you know, it'll be a keynote.  
It'll be a thing on the schedule tab. So.

[@29:38](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1778.88) \- Denise Shannon  
I'm just opening that to look at it. Cool.

[@29:49](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1789.06) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay. I got to hop while you guys, while you guys mess around with this. I'm going to, I'm going to leave this going so that you can just shout out any notes or questions you have for me and the bot should pick it up and then I'll be.  
Well, implement them. Bot, note taker, pay attention from here on out.

[@30:07](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1807.16) \- Denise Shannon  
It will make it a lot easier to update. if I say, bot, note taker, don't pay attention from here on out.  
Reverse, reverse.

[@30:25](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1825.44) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. I don't know what to say here. I lied. need to change the, I need to swap the meetings.  
Oh, you need to salute. Yeah, it's using this account.

[@30:51](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1851.66) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Denise, I'm just going to keep editing and we'll jump on ours at two.

[@30:54](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1854.62) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. You don't need to extend any end dates. I had, I had Tracy do it all. No, I haven't.

[@30:59](https://fathom.video/share/Lyo-cLz-fUvFPGb-AcbvXnRGPMXsuNEY?timestamp=1859.96) \- Stefanie Murray  
haven't.

[@0:05](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=5.06) \- Denise Shannon  
You can keep your music playing. Okay.  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=8.992712)

[@0:11](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=11.7) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
It's working on the schedule page here. It's looking for this public checkbox. So we can do like this, this, this, this.  
And then within a minute or two, it should, which should start showing up with the schedule sessions that are available.  
looks like it's warm up.

[@0:36](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=36.04) \- Denise Shannon  
Me too.

[@0:38](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=38.02) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
And what's really cool is check this out. Now, when you go to sign in, you sign in to do your account, you can say, I've already purchased tickets.

[@0:46](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=46.5) \- Denise Shannon  
And then you don't get the buttons anymore.

[@0:49](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=49.36) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
And then when we go to the schedule, let's see, do I have to build again? on. My body, I got it, looking like.  
I want to see something pretty cool, actually, that I'm very proud of, that I built for myself. So, you know, I work in the command prompt here in, like, having it work on our files.  
What was driving me crazy is that, you know, when you open a command prompt, it looks like this. You know, and, you know, that's fine.  
But you can't do, like, audio commands. I have to switch Windows to, like, go back to the terminal, and then I have to use the stupid Windows, Windows H, you know, hello, hello, this is my, you know, voice to text.  
And look, it looks like . So I've made my own. So now I can just, now I can just go, like, I can use keyboard shortcuts to hide this stuff.  
And then I can just hit Alt-A. And it'll use Google transcription and then automatically send it no matter what window I have open so that I don't have to touch my mouse.  
I could just trigger the commands.

[@2:15](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=135.24) \- Denise Shannon  
I told Stephanie a couple of weeks ago, I'm like, Joe's job should be reclassified.

[@2:23](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=143.44) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I'm kind of breaking, I'm escaping containment here. I probably should reel it back in a little bit.

[@2:29](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=149.62) \- Denise Shannon  
But no, I mean, all this stuff has so much, is so beneficial for our longer term growth. It's crazy.  
Like all you have to do is put your And if you could just concentrate on this and ways to drive more revenue.  
I don't know what to make your title, but. I like operations, but I don't, I think you're right.

[@2:59](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=179.82) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I don't. I think it captures, I think.

[@3:03](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=183.3) \- Denise Shannon  
Well, it doesn't capture enough of what you're doing, for sure. Okay, so that should work.

[@3:09](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=189.38) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Let's see.

[@3:10](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=190.22) \- Denise Shannon  
you know, I'm selfishly also trying to promote myself, so. There you go. I'm down. You get a new title.  
We team up.

[@3:18](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=198.28) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
We team up. We'll make it work.

[@3:19](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=199.8) \- Denise Shannon  
I get a new title. But there isn't any for me.

[@3:26](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=206.02) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I'm down. All right, so let's see if this worked now. Once this deploy is finished, I just click the Update button.  
And the good news is that the Update button in the Site Content thing, if you make changes to the schedule, for example, and you want to, like, you know, you want to see those schedules reflected, you just come back to Site Content, and you can click Update.  
I think, let me just see. Let just see here. I think if you click Tools, Extensions, okay, yeah, you can just click the button from there, no matter what tab you're on.

[@3:58](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=238.16) \- Denise Shannon

So, I mean, I just have to, I guess I just have to keep going like through this. It's, it's what you design looks really nice and it's not difficult to update.  
It's just like, I have to completely like rethink, you know what I mean?

[@5:18](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=318.4) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)

Okay, Montclair, Philly. First World War, Chicago, D.C., Detroit. Where did you get these little taglines, like Detroit Global Impact?  
Okay.

[@8:00](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=480.0) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Uh, those were auto, most of those are auto-generated and then I think you can tell because they're title case for some reason.

[@8:05](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=485.72) \- Stefanie Murray

So I need to, the only one that I did change was partnerships with a purpose and I don't, it, it must have recapitalized it, but, um, yeah.  
And then it kept counting, uh, eight cities, even though Montclair was, is represented twice.

[@8:20](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=500.76) \- Stefanie Murray

[@8:43](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=523.16) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. Okay. So these right here. Okay. Yep. There you go. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, um, I just have to.  
Like focus on this and I am going to do my best today, but I also need to get back on the phone, call a couple of neurologists before they close.  
And then Denise, have to go over a couple of things. Denise, how do you feel about the, we didn't get anything back from Morgan yet?

[@9:17](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=557.621) \- Denise Shannon  
Mm-mm, we haven't. We just got the one proposal that reduced it to 30\. He didn't get back to us with, well, I had requested the no lunch version, but then we talked about for $5 more doing the lunch.  
So I'm not sure what we actually are doing.

[@9:41](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=581.461) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. We don't know what we're doing yet, exactly.

[@9:52](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=592.281) \- Denise Shannon  
And it's probably too soon to ping Althea.

[@9:56](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=596.881) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, probably too soon. All right. So what should we do? I feel like we're done with making decisions like, oh, maybe not.

[@10:15](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=615.401) \- Denise Shannon  
I think we need to get squared away on price because we're jumping around doing like a bunch of different things.

Why don't we get squared on price and then I can go in and double check, triple check your Eventbrite.

[@10:34](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=634.001) \- Stefanie Murray  
$249. Okay.

[@10:41](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=641.461) \- Stefanie Murray  
Early bird?

[@10:46](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=646.101) \- Denise Shannon  
$150?

I just never like doing early bird.

[@10:50](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=650.621) \- Denise Shannon  
No early bird? I don't really want to do early registration. Strap it.

[@10:55](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=655.201) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
No early birds.

[@10:56](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=656.501) \- Denise Shannon  
I mean, we got maybe 14 last year. Last year. And then, you know, people just dragged their feet and then we ended up giving away.  
I'd rather just have a price.

[@11:08](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=668.061) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. One price doesn't change.

[@11:10](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=670.281) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
All righty.

[@11:13](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=673.981) \- Denise Shannon  
All right. So I can go in and go through the Eventbrite, test it all. Really?

[@11:21](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=681.141) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

[@11:24](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=684.141) \- Denise Shannon  
So if I need to make any edits, I can do them the traditional way.

[@11:28](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=688.861) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Just edit the, just edit. The Eventbrite, and we're good. Yep. Okay.

[@11:33](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=693.341) \- Denise Shannon  
Excuse me. Sorry.

[@11:38](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=698.181) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. just still say it's Hayden. So it's going to be like $30,000 to give people lunch, two lunches and a breakfast.

[@11:52](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=712.101) \- Denise Shannon  
Correct. Mm-hmm. Right. Two..1 It's,000. Two lunches, one breakfast.

[@12:02](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=722.121) \- Stefanie Murray  
Is there other costs that are also there besides the per-person cost?

[@12:09](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=729.461) \- Denise Shannon  
There are room rentals for day two that we could reduce potentially once we get to assigning space.

[@12:21](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=741.501) \- Stefanie Murray  
But they do charge you. But it's not going to make it.

[@12:25](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=745.821) \- Denise Shannon  
They're still going to charge per person for the meeting package. We can reduce the number of rooms that we're working out of, but that's not going to.

[@12:36](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=756.061) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, but they still charge for the rooms, too. It's per person and then for the rooms.

[@12:43](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=763.181) \- Denise Shannon  
Yes. Yes. So the room is the only variable that we could cut rooms that we're going to use on day two.  
There's nothing we can cut from day one other than.

[@12:56](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=776.641) \- Stefanie Murray  
And this is based on how many people?

[@12:59](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=779.061) \- Denise Shannon  
150\. Okay. Which is exactly $200.

[@13:16](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=796.861) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. So I'm pausing now thinking because now I'm like knowing the full cost and we've had these conversations with them and everything.

[@13:49](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=829.261) \- Denise Shannon  
Do we need to spend $15,000 for a half day on Monday? Right.

[@14:00](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=840.001) \- Stefanie Murray  
And what if we don't do anything at the Friday Center on Monday at all? What if we just do something completely somewhere else Monday?

[@14:11](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=851.181) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. Yeah, because I think he quoted that it would be like $65 for the half day.

[@14:26](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=866.541) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yep. Monday.

[@14:28](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=868.821) \- Denise Shannon  
Yep. Which brings it down to $97.50, but that's literally for snacks and an auditorium.

[@14:36](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=876.281) \- Stefanie Murray  
That's right.

[@14:43](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=883.161) \- Denise Shannon  
I mean, I know INN has a lot more money than this, but I can't imagine that they're not scratching their heads on these prices too.

[@14:51](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=891.681) \- Stefanie Murray  
Well, I think they're not because they're going to use it all day. And to them, the full use of that full.  
Conference space all day is cheaper than a hotel.

[@15:07](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=907.681) \- Denise Shannon  
So now I'm thinking, as we think this through, give it a little space to breathe in my mind here.

[@15:15](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=915.701) \- Stefanie Murray  
Why would I drag everyone there for a couple hours in an auditorium for $15,000 dollars, instead have everybody fly in that day and then we do something off-site with a keynote speaker and something fun.  
And then Tuesday we're at the Friday Center all day. That way we could roll the cost of the dinner and Monday into one thing.  
So I do not want to spend $15,000 on, you know, snacks and a lunch that maybe 60 people are going to show up to and then have...  
I beg people to come to a dinner, too. I was trying to throw all that out the window and then redesign.  
Let's just do one fun thing. Great keynote speaker, fun event. But that puts a lot of pressure on you because now we have to come up with a place.  
We could also ask Mel Kramer, too. She lives right there. She's super civically involved. She's got other ideas, too, in addition to what we might already have.  
Is that planetarium open?

[@16:34](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=994.581) \- Denise Shannon  
I did not reach out to them yet. Let me share my screen for them. I just want to show you.  
I pulled up the Botanical Garden, which is a walking distance. I know they can't accommodate us on Monday night, but...  
SCREEN SHARING: Denise started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1016.396091)  
they can me So they have this huge education center, which is an auditorium that can be divided in half.  
200 theater style seating, 160 rounds, 120 if we did something else. So, I mean, it doesn't have to be for a dinner.  
It could be for, you know, keynote with a stage. And I don't know about the classroom space. I mean, obviously it looks elementary, but it looks like there's a few classrooms.

[@17:55](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1075.08) \- Stefanie Murray  
It looks fine, but I want to be able to, like, if we're going to throw this off.

[@18:00](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1080.0) \- Denise Shannon  
I don't want to go to two places on Monday.

[@18:02](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1082.34) \- Stefanie Murray  
rather just go to one that's like right next to each other or right there.

[@18:05](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1085.68) \- Denise Shannon

[@18:14](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1094.6) \- Stefanie Murray  
That looks pretty, though.

[@18:16](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1096.54) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, I mean, it's a walking distance, you said, too? I believe so. Unless, you know, we have anybody with mobility needs.  
Let me just pull it up on the map again. No, not. Here we go. The right one. Let just pull up just pull pull pull You

I just need you locked in for like a minute and a half. Here we go. Okay. So as the – when we launch, this will be how the site works.  
And I already mentioned that the sessions over here on the schedule page – don't know. Actually, told Denise, but this is how we are going to be building the schedule page as well.  
It'll auto-update when you click the videos. and I'll So, So at any time you want to update the schedule, you auto-update by clicking run on that or you go back to the other one.  
But when it's public, this is the public sessions and this is how they'll appear. Once it's public, this is what it'll look like on the schedule page.  
Right now, you can see that it's just, you know, it's our verbatim notes here. So we'll want to make sure we keep this clean until we click public or when we have anything public.  
But for purposes of demonstration, I'm showing you this. New users, new people, attendees will be here and we're going to, have instructed for them.  
They're going to sign in. And they can sign in with a one-time password with their email address or they can just use Google.  
It shows you which one you used last. You sign in. It's very simple, very quick. And once you sign in, you get, hey, you get your page here.  
You can either get your tickets immediately or you can say, I've already purchased tickets. And you can also build your schedule, your own schedule.

So you come here on the schedule page. You bookmark your schedule that you want. Boom. All this stuff. Now it's showing all of them, not just the public ones.  
I'm going to fix that. But let's say you make your schedule. Cool. Done. I got my schedule. I go back to my dashboard, and now I can see my schedule right here, and I can share it, or I can add more.  
I can share it privately. I can share over attendees only to see it, or I can share it publicly, and then someone clicks this, and then they can see the schedule that you've put together if you want to follow along, and then you can see their profile and all that kind of stuff as well.

[@22:25](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1345.4) \- Denise Shannon  
Is there any way that we could share that information by a mistake, like our working document? There's no way someone could go in, make an update, and it populate anywhere else other than where we're working.

that show public here. So if, as long as it's not checked public, it won't appear on the website when this is done, which should be done in like a minute and a half.

Okay. So now I'm finally done reading page one.

[@23:45](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1425.24) \- Denise Shannon  
Can we make the, um, the banner that says 10th anniversary edition, like more interesting. Is that a good idea?

[@23:54](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1434.12) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. about. says 10th Thank Okay. So the about page just goes to this page. So we should remove that.

[@24:09](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1449.44) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Wait, say that again? The about? It just is the same page. okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good.

[@24:17](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1457.5) \- Stefanie Murray  
History. Oh, that's just jumping. Oh, I thought those were other pages.

[@24:23](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1463.1) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Nope.

[@24:27](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1467.1) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. then we can also add, the Knight Foundation has already sponsored it.

[@24:31](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1471.84) \- Denise Shannon  
Mm-hmm.

[@24:35](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1475.1) \- Stefanie Murray  
So we can add a sponsor block that at least has Knight on it. And then when I click schedule, it got, it's getting weird.

[@24:51](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1491.7) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
When you click schedule? What do you mean? What happened?

[@24:56](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1496.08) \- Stefanie Murray  
Hang on, let me go back.

That's what makes it so valuable. Let me see. Okay. So when you click schedule, what happens? So that looks better now.

[@25:12](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1512.34) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. So then I clicked schedule. Okay. Now it worked. So what happened before was I was down here and I clicked schedule and it does that.

[@25:22](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1522.8) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Scroll up.

[@25:25](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1525.4) \- Stefanie Murray  
So I didn't, so, you know, I don't wonder why I did that.

[@25:30](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1530.48) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay. All right. I'm already scrolled to the bottom of the page.

[@25:33](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1533.92) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. Yeah.

[@25:34](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1534.5) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
You want to make sure it returns, it returns to the top of the page when, when someone navigates to a new tab.

[@25:40](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1540.18) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. Personally, I hate that, but I think that's better, a better way to go. Why would you just for pagination.

[@25:46](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1546.64) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Actually, it's mostly just for, like if I'm scrolling down to page one, I want to go to the next page of results and it scrolls me all the way back out to the top.  
Again, that's a scroll down to click three and that drives me crazy. So I didn't, I didn't add that, but you're right.

[@25:58](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1558.1) \- Stefanie Murray

I can do it in a few minutes. Okay, but I want to see how Stephanie does it because she finds interesting, cool ways to.

Yeah, well, I was just doing that for demonstration. go to Airtable, you uncheck the public box, and it won't show up on the schedule page.  
I'm sorry, the schedule tab. Okay, but I want to delete all that stuff.

[@26:28](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1588.94) \- Stefanie Murray  
I don't want any of that even possible. So uncheck all the public boxes to the right. So this is my brain dump, so I don't want this anywhere near anything.

[@26:38](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1598.76) \- Denise Shannon  
That's why I was asking, Joe, is there any that we could mistakenly share?

[@26:44](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1604.06) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, let's move the brain dump to not the official schedule tab.

[@26:47](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1607.62) \- Stefanie Murray  
Well, yeah, because this is where we were brainstorming, and then you took it and made it your official I know, I know, but that's just always the tab that we use for the official schedule page, so I figured we would use that one like usual, but that's okay.

[@26:58](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1618.58) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay, we can move it. To a brain dump tab or something like that. We just copied the whole thing.

[@27:03](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1623.98) \- Stefanie Murray  
This is just where we were just catching stuff.

[@27:05](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1625.94) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I know. I knew that when I was setting it up. I just wanted to see if it would work.  
So because that's usually where the schedule eventually ultimately lives.

[@27:12](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1632.44) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, it will eventually. But didn't you have another? You can just duplicate the tab if you want.

[@27:19](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1639.28) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)

[@27:27](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1647.8) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, I would just assume that you had another one. Duplicate table.

[@27:32](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=1652.66) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)

[@38:08](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=2288.94) \- Stefanie Murray  
Why? Because if we let people skip this, but we tell them this will appear on their attendee badge, and some people fill it out here and some people don't, we print badges from Eventbrite, not from here.

I got to change the phrasing because I have badges that automatically apply to your account when you tell us how long you've been coming.  
You can upload a photo if you want. Optional.

There's a bunch of stuff I have planned on the roadmap of what I want to use this for, but this also is like de facto data collection.

[@38:57](https://fathom.video/share/BJUoKdcd17_XAonfAc6U596FS-YU5Pxx?timestamp=2337.94) \- Stefanie Murray

Yep. Perfect. This is exactly the feedback I want. You can edit this later as well, so you don't have to go crazy with it.  
Yep. Okay. Which summits of you attended? This is my favorite I know you're very excited about this, This is my favorite.  
Look at the badges. Look at them piling up. You get special ones if you do just the 2020 and 2021\.  
You get Pandemic Warrior. You get Zoom or Zoom Veteran. You get all kinds of stuff. Okay, cool. So then you have more options you can do here.  
You can click Get My Tickets, or if you've already purchased tickets, you can check that and that goes away.
