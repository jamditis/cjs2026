[VIEW RECORDING \- 32 mins (No highlights)](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V)

[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=0.0) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
MIT has run it out of New York, and their contract ends on June 30th, and they were negotiating with the state to extend it.  
The negotiations fell through, so now there's no one to run our public TV station after June 30th of next year.  
So Montclair State is applying to do that.

[@0:20](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=20.58) \- Courtney  
It's getting, I see. Okay, that'd be a big deal.

[@0:23](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=23.72) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
It'd be a big deal. How about you? How was UNC?

[@0:29](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=29.22) \- Courtney  
It was great.

[@0:30](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=30.64) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah?

[@0:31](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=31.5) \- Courtney  
It was really great. Yeah, yeah. Like the highlight, I don't know if I shared this, the highlight is like spatially, like when you're in the conference, it's everything, when we look at it from an IND's perspective, that we would need.  
It doesn't necessarily have like the amenities that we hope for, are not required, but we hope for, like that give people spaces to escape during the day or when they walk out.  
Thank you. Walk around and be in a local neighborhood or in a downtown area, you know, close by restaurants, like, yeah, it's not crazy, like, but it's just not, like, it's not in the heart of anything.  
It's on a sort of extended area of campus and sits against the parking lot. But like, once you're in the space, like, it's everything we need.  
So it's, um, my recommendation is, like, we, at least for INN days, we move forward with it. And then we can create experiences, like, we can get, we can do lawn games, we can do other things to, like, make it fun.

[@1:39](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=99.66) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep, yep. That sounds good to us.

[@1:41](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=101.92) \- Courtney  
Cool. Okay. So, um, I send an agenda that I'll go, we'll go through these together. But the big thing today will be to sort of determine what your spatial needs are, because ideally, I'd like to be able to go back to you.  
UNC and say, hey, here's what CCM needs. Here's what we need. On which days can you go and draft and resend us final proposals, basically.  
And then a little bit about how they work is when I go through what is, quote, included, they have like a base price per person.  
That's how they do it. And whatever is, quote, included is sort of like included in that base price. It could be like $80 to $90 a person.  
It sort of depends on, I think, how many rooms, quantity, right? So I can't really give you a figure, but they'll send you their range.  
And then there are things that you can add on. So when I name like this is included, that will be included in the rate you're given.  
But when I say this is an add-on, this would be like, they can do this, but it costs more.  
It's on top of what is included. But yeah, ideally today we'd be able to walk away with like what rooms, how we divvy up the rooms on Tuesday so that we can lock in the contracts.  
And then I will say they're open to us locking in everything that's included and things that we want to add on.  
can have conversations with them like after the initial contract period. So just that we get it locked. don't know if that makes sense.

[@3:24](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=204.18) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay. That makes sense.

[@3:25](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=205.24) \- Courtney  
Yep. Okay. So walking through.

[@3:28](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=208.42) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah. Could you, so we, we, we, we watched a couple of the videos and we've seen a couple of the photos.  
We just have a couple of questions about capacity for some of the rooms.

[@3:38](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=218.12) \- Courtney  
don't know if you know some of these. Do you want to just jump into questions?

[@3:41](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=221.24) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah.

[@3:41](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=221.96) \- Courtney  
We've already been through all this. Yeah. Okay.

[@3:44](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=224.32) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So what are your questions? So what do you know what the capacities are for like bellflower and windflower in those corner rooms?

[@3:51](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=231.12) \- Courtney  
Yeah. Let me, oh yeah, I should have attached that too.

[@3:55](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=235.68) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah. That's okay. Or even like Willow Lounge or those others. Cause we're assuming that. Like those corner rooms, Mount Laurel, Azalea, Winter, you know, Windflower, Bellflower, and then Willow Lounge and Magnolia Lounge.  
Like how are the lounges different too?

[@4:12](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=252.46) \- Courtney  
The lounges, okay, here's spatial layout. I mean, like a capacity charts.

[@4:23](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=263.74) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Oh, perfect.

[@4:25](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=265.84) \- Courtney  
Okay, we were missing out.

[@4:28](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=268.44) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Great, great, great.

[@4:29](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=269.42) \- Courtney  
The lounges, the lounges are open spaces that people can like, the lounges are not private rooms. I wouldn't do like, but you can, oh, okay.  
Yeah, the lounges are like, they literally are lounges. They're like opening atrium spaces. But then you could see the breakouts.  
And then I don't know if you can see, but are you, if you look at the venue map, hold on.

[@4:54](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=294.14) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
I'm on the venue map.

[@4:55](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=295.22) \- Courtney  
You are?

[@4:55](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=295.8) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay.

[@4:55](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=295.9) \- Courtney  
Okay. When you look at the venue map, um So the dogwood, redbud, as well as the four rooms that are kind of the same, like the mountain, laurel, azalea, bellflower, windflower, those can all be split.

[@5:19](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=319.52) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay.

[@5:20](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=320.62) \- Courtney  
So when you look at the capacity chart, does it have the split in here? It does not.

[@5:28](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=328.06) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, so like redbud, for example, could be split into like roughly half-ish.

[@5:33](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=333.48) \- Courtney  
We'll just assume.

[@5:34](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=334.1) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah.

[@5:34](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=334.68) \- Courtney  
I'm going to send you the one they sent me because it's like, it shows the split in a little bit better.  
Yeah.

[@5:47](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=347.52) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So what we think that we're going to, and the dining room is where all the food, that's exactly what it sounds like, right?

[@5:53](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=353.36) \- Courtney  
That's food.

[@5:54](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=354.06) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah. Okay, great. Okay, so from our perspective, we think we would actually use the auditorium. Because we like something where we can kind of, like the auditorium's got the big, it's got a little stage, you know, it's huge, but we're not too worried about that because we can block off some of the back seats.  
And we just think it provides like a better visual for us than being in a, so on Monday, we would probably use the auditorium and then like maybe Redbud and Wintergreen if needed, but we probably won't even need them.  
Probably it's mostly be in the auditorium. And then Tuesday morning, we'd go back in the auditorium and then we do workshops for a few hours.  
So if we could have like the auditorium in the morning for a couple hours and then maybe, you know, Redbud split in half or those two corner ones, Bellflower and Windflower, that's probably going to be plenty for us.

[@6:53](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=413.64) \- Courtney  
Okay, so all day, let's talk Monday, because Monday's a half.

[@7:00](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=420.0) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Fath day. Yep. Monday we'll be in the auditorium.

[@7:03](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=423.06) \- Courtney  
So Monday you need the auditorium and no breakouts?

[@7:06](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=426.2) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
I don't think we're going to need any breakouts Monday.

[@7:08](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=428.16) \- Courtney  
Nope. Okay. So then Tuesday, will you need the meal room?

[@7:12](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=432.5) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So on Tuesday, say that again?

[@7:15](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=435.64) \- Courtney  
On Monday, will you need the meal room?

[@7:18](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=438.44) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Good question. Possibly. We want to provide snacks.

[@7:24](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=444.94) \- Courtney  
They can do snacks in the hallway. Okay.

[@7:28](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=448.24) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah.

[@7:28](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=448.96) \- Courtney  
The only time you need the meal room, if you're going have folks sitting, eating a meal?

[@7:33](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=453.24) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Tuesday, we will.

[@7:34](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=454.68) \- Courtney  
Okay.

[@7:35](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=455.48) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Tuesday, want to open for breakfast in the meal room and then go into the auditorium. And then we'll need breakout room.

[@7:45](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=465.5) \- Courtney  
So we could probably about the breakout room?

[@7:47](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=467.04) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
You said you want it?

[@7:47](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=467.84) \- Courtney  
Oh, sorry.

[@7:48](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=468.42) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
We could probably, like, depending on what you guys need, we could split Redbud Wintergreen. Like, if we split Redbud in half, we could use Redbud and Wintergreen.  
Or we could probably could have three breakouts. breakouts. Yeah. Well, two, probably two, probably no more than two.

[@8:07](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=487.541) \- Courtney  
Redbud can be split in half.

[@8:09](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=489.261) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So if Redbud's split in half, that would be probably more than enough, Denise, I think.

[@8:12](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=492.721) \- Courtney  
Or we could take Bellflower and Windflower down. Yeah, maybe you would, because you could have, you could put your staff office in their storage.

[@8:21](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=501.361) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Like you might want. Yeah, so I was to also ask about that. Like, should we designate one of these rooms?

[@8:26](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=506.981) \- Courtney  
Yeah, what I would do with one.

[@8:28](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=508.801) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, what do they use?

[@8:30](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=510.001) \- Courtney  
If you want to do this that way, here's what I would recommend. Yeah.

[@8:35](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=515.021) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Where's my, just based on what I. Like, we could use, like, Grumman and Jessamine on Monday, and then the dining room, Grumman, Jessamine, and then the two corner rooms on Tuesday, and up until, you know, like, we're done at two or something.  
SCREEN SHARING: Courtney started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=528.600702)

[@8:52](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=532.441) \- Courtney  
Yeah, so Grumman will be the auditorium, Trillian will be your meal room. And then what I would do is just take.  
take. They're mirrored, so just all of these or all of these sort of sounds fine to us, yeah.

[@9:07](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=547.38) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay.

[@9:07](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=547.66) \- Courtney  
More space than we're going to need, so on Tuesday, so, you know, whatever. you'll get one breakout, one breakout.  
This is a boardroom.

[@9:15](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=555.04) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
The difference, let me show you the difference between these two.

[@9:17](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=557.2) \- Courtney  
So this one's a boardroom, and this one's, like, more like a classroom. Let me pull up the picture, though, so you can.  
Let's see it. And you can pick which one you want. So, and there, the one that says boardroom looks like.

[@9:48](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=588.4) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Where is it?

[@9:49](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=589.56) \- Courtney  
Looks like this.

[@9:50](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=590.02) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
you link up that folder? I should look at that folder. Okay. Okay, gotcha.

[@9:54](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=594.92) \- Courtney  
Yep. And then the one that looks. It's in the open. It's in the big share.

[@9:59](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=599.96) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
share. Drive folder.

[@10:01](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=601.281) \- Courtney  
I can represent it. And then the wintergreen looks like this. It's like a classroom.

[@10:06](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=606.501) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Ah, okay.

[@10:07](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=607.421) \- Courtney  
Okay. And then what you guys are seeing, Redwood and Dogwood are the same.

[@10:12](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=612.801) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So it's this room, except what you would do is split them. Yep.

[@10:17](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=617.641) \- Courtney  
If you wanted two separate rooms.

[@10:19](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=619.521) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep. And we would.

[@10:20](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=620.621) \- Courtney  
We want two separate rooms. And they each fit capacity. Classroom 100\. I don't know how they do this. no, no.  
Classroom, they fit 40\. Okay. That's right. If you split them up, the classroom, it fits 40\.

[@10:40](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=640.801) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Theater, it fits 90\. Okay.

[@10:44](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=644.481) \- Denise Shannon  
And is there a screen, if it's split, is there a screen for both sections?

[@10:49](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=649.661) \- Courtney  
That, I think there is. I think, I think she did say there was, but you'd have to ask. Okay.  
I think there is.

[@10:58](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=658.461) \- Denise Shannon  
I think, and then are you.

[@11:00](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=660.001) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
You're going to feed people lunch on Tuesday, Courtney, or when does your programming start on Tuesday?

[@11:04](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=664.401) \- Courtney  
Yeah, we would probably do continental breakfast on Tuesday and lunch because it won't be that many people.

[@11:14](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=674.021) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah. How many people are you going to have?

[@11:16](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=676.261) \- Courtney  
It will be like 150 at the most on that day.

[@11:20](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=680.361) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay. So we would probably have about 100 to 125, and we would be doing the same. We'd be doing breakfast and lunch.

[@11:27](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=687.221) \- Courtney  
Yeah.

[@11:27](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=687.881) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
wonder if we just, how we work that, if we can just- Well, basically how they do meals is they just set a menu.

[@11:34](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=694.541) \- Courtney  
They kind of, it's interesting.

[@11:35](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=695.881) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
They like set a menu. They have a Monday menu, a Tuesday Monday, you know what I'm saying? Yep.

[@11:41](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=701.721) \- Courtney  
And basically, they usually, they're used to working with multiple parties. So what will happen is like Tuesday, the menu will already be set, and then they will just be quantities for both- Events.  
Oh, It will be centralized. Okay. that make sense? Okay. And like the mill rooms are like, and they put, I wondered if I took a picture, which I probably.

[@12:04](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=724.601) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
That's great. I actually really like that.

[@12:05](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=725.941) \- Courtney  
That's great. Because then we can say we have 125 people. And we have 100 in, and we have 100\.  
So what they'll do, it'll be one buffet area for everybody, one coffee area for everybody.

[@12:18](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=738.781) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Everything will be the same, but they'll just do it for. it so easy. Exactly. Yeah.

[@12:23](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=743.401) \- Courtney  
Great.

[@12:23](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=743.861) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So is that going to be enough room for you if we are using a couple of the breakout rooms?

[@12:28](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=748.341) \- Courtney  
Yeah. Yeah. Because if we get, if, if you're only using that corner, we would use the other corner for our, for our, for our, um, perfect.  
And we won't use the mill room. We won't need the mill room at all. We would just use, I guess this is a question of, do you want the boardroom or do you want, okay, good.  
Cause I think we would want the boardroom. So basically if that's the case, then you all should take, um, I think the bottom law should take this corner.

[@12:58](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=778.301) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep.

[@12:58](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=778.941) \- Courtney  
That's one red bud one. The Willow Lounge, which would be nice if you just want, like, people to take calls and whatever.  
And then that way you can have sponsors. The sponsors, like, if you have a sponsor table set up, it could go here in this lounge, or you could organize them in this hallway that are central to the dining and the auditorium.

[@13:26](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=806.801) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@13:27](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=807.541) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
We usually don't have a lot, but sometimes we have two or three, so. Yeah. We had four or five last year.

[@13:32](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=812.761) \- Courtney  
Yeah. Okay. Okay, great. Okay. So you all would take this corner.

[@13:38](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=818.701) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
You don't need sunflower. That's another big room. Nope. I didn't even notice sunflower. Yeah, we don't need sunflower.

[@13:44](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=824.981) \- Courtney  
And the good thing about this is that this could be, like, staff office. Actually, there is a separate staff office.  
So there's, like, a little room that's a staff office. But these are, like, let me see.

[@14:00](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=840.702) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Courtney, I'll be right back. Denise's got one.

[@14:02](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=842.882) \- Denise Shannon  
Cool.

[@14:03](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=843.742) \- Courtney  
These rooms, bellflower and windflower, they're mirrored. They look like this. They're tiny rooms, but you could also have like your staff office and storage in here or whatever.

[@14:18](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=858.942) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. And they're reconfigurable if we requested a U-shape or a... Yeah, the only room that's not reconfigurable is Sunflower because it has these fixed...  
Oh, they are.

[@14:33](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=873.282) \- Courtney  
Yeah. You won't even need that.

[@14:36](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=876.242) \- Denise Shannon  
No, definitely not.

[@14:37](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=877.562) \- Courtney  
I was trying to show... Yeah, I will load a Zoom of the foyer because I think I recorded that via Zoom, not on my phone.  
So you can see the atrium area. You can see what this area looks like.

[@14:57](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=897.122) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, and I noticed that there's a north and a south... So do they have an area that they prefer, like a registration gets set up in, or?

[@15:07](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=907.982) \- Courtney  
I found that this was the main entrance they recommend. Okay. But if people are staying at the Courtyard Hotel, this is the, to me, this is the closer.  
So like, for us, I was saying like, I would probably, the only thing is like, the meal, the food is set up right here.  
So maybe registration would be like, you know, this is a wall, you don't really see that the doors on this side, maybe registration is here, because you'd walk in, the buffet lines are right here.  
And then you'd have to just point people to registration, or maybe it's in the center. But yeah.

[@15:55](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=955.982) \- Denise Shannon  
And the space that says, you know, that's control room, can we...

[@16:00](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=960.002) \- Courtney  
Can up against that if we needed to? No, that control room is, oh yeah, you can set up against it.

[@16:10](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=970.682) \- Denise Shannon  
I'm just wondering, like for the sake of, if we're going to be in that lower right quadrant and we don't want to confuse people, obviously Monday is not going to matter because nobody will be there.  
But then on Tuesday, we may have, you know, some stragglers that didn't register and.

[@16:30](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=990.002) \- Courtney  
We might want to be right across from one another or something like that. Oh, here's a great picture. Okay, so the atrium sort of looks like this.  
SCREEN SHARING: Courtney started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1001.12827)

[@16:44](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1004.02) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@16:45](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1005.08) \- Courtney  
So that media, that media room is just like a granite hallway. Oh, okay. But you'd be able to park here, for example, if you wanted.

[@16:58](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1018.82) \- Denise Shannon  
Thank you. I like your idea of being located closer to each other. just probably would make more sense.

[@17:08](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1028.84) \- Courtney  
Because we'll have like random check-in and then we'll have people checking in for the workshop. So we could probably have our check-ins very close to one another.  
And we have such few traffic that we could probably be at the same check-in that Tuesday. It's not going to be busy for us.

[@17:30](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1050.0) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah.

[@17:32](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1052.3) \- Courtney  
Because likely our reception is going to be off-site. So people aren't really coming here for INN days until they'll come to the workshop.  
But if you're just coming to the conference, you wouldn't even come in here until Wednesday.

[@17:46](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1066.22) \- Denise Shannon  
Right. Okay. Got it. And do they have any, so you're going to do an off-site reception. Do they have any flexibility with their menu at night?

[@17:59](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1079.08) \- Courtney  
Like, can we break? So they have, if you wanted to, oh yeah, if you wanted to do the award ceremony, I would do it in the Trillium Room or the dinner, plate of dinner.  
You have to use their caterer.

[@18:13](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1093.3) \- Denise Shannon  
You do have to, okay.

[@18:14](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1094.34) \- Courtney  
But they are flexible in terms of, like, if you're like, like I was mentioning, like, well, we would really want to do like North Carolina, like barbecue, you know?  
And they were like, yeah, well, we could work with a third party, but it just has to be through them.  
like, they would source.

[@18:34](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1114.08) \- Denise Shannon  
Perfect.

[@18:40](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1120.04) \- Courtney  
Yeah, so.

[@18:43](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1123.3) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, I think that can work really well. Stephanie, only thing you missed is we talked about registration for stay and potentially being located close to each other to sort of, you know, not make it confusing for who needs

[@19:00](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1140.52) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
That makes sense. And then, I'm sorry, I didn't hear the second. So what you just said about the evening event is we could do it there, but bring in off-site catering.

[@19:09](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1149.66) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, you could, they have their own plate-at-dinner menu.

[@19:13](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1153.14) \- Courtney  
They have their own, well, they don't, I think they have a buffet dinner menu.

[@19:17](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1157.24) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@19:17](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1157.76) \- Courtney  
Yeah, briefly looked at But they do plate-at-dinner, it's just an added cost, and they probably have a menu they can work with, but if you were really particular, like, we want to bring in, a certain type of, you know, whatever, then they can do that.  
They can also do alcoholic drinks, as I understand. I don't know to what degree, but they basically work with a third party, but you do have to go through them.

[@19:44](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1184.72) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
You can't bring in your own catering. Yeah, or we could just also look off-site, too.

[@19:49](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1189.6) \- Courtney  
Or you could look off-site.

[@19:50](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1190.92) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Which might be more fun.

[@19:51](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1191.96) \- Courtney  
So what I think what I would tell them, like, what I'm going to tell them is, like, you all want the auditorium on Monday, all day, right?  
right. Because you want, would you need to prep it?

[@20:03](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1203.34) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yes.

[@20:04](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1204.38) \- Courtney  
Do you need anything Sunday?

[@20:06](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1206.46) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
No.

[@20:07](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1207.32) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@20:07](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1207.78) \- Courtney  
So auditorium Monday, Monday, and then Tuesday, you'll take that upper, I mean, that lower corner of the space along with the auditorium and trillium during the day.

[@20:19](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1219.86) \- Denise Shannon  
Yep.

[@20:20](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1220.74) \- Courtney  
We would take the upper corner, we would share our meals, and then I'll let you talk with them about the reception.  
ACTION ITEM: Email UNC Friday Center re: CCM/INN space plan; request final proposals; cc Denise; handoff \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1226.9999)  
I'll just tell them, both have receptions, but we're trying, we don't know where exactly, so that can come later.  
But yeah. Does that sound good? Mm-hmm.

[@20:36](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1236.28) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay.

[@20:37](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1237.22) \- Courtney  
Yep. That good. I'll send that like right after this, and I'll keep you posted on how quickly we are executing it, because once we get it, we're going to like move.  
You have to put down a 25% deposit that's non-refundable, but unlike a hotel, which is great, there's, you have to come, you have like 45 days out.  
go. I'll To change your order, which is like a lot of flexibility for us. Change your order, you mean in terms of like the space that you're using?  
you could be like, we don't need this room anymore and it's only going to 8 people. You got 45, which is very generous, I feel.  
yep, yep. And then we're getting room blocks at that courtyard.

[@21:23](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1283.1) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
That was my, yeah, next question, yeah.

[@21:25](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1285.68) \- Courtney  
Right now, we just put in a proposal for room blocks for, like, before we, like, confirmed, we just did it our conference day.  
So, there's, it's a low number on Monday, but we can see what they have available Monday. I think it would be easier to do the room block under one, I don't know.

[@21:50](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1310.3) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, we don't ever do room blocks, so. Oh, you don't? No, ever, never.

[@21:53](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1313.9) \- Courtney  
Oh, okay, so we don't even have to worry about that.

[@21:55](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1315.92) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, we have only ever done it once and it was a, we hated it. You never want do it again.  
But if it's, like, require something, we'll do it.

[@22:04](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1324.8) \- Courtney  
no, no, it's not required.

[@22:05](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1325.86) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, otherwise, if we just tell people you can book here or wherever, they'll just book wherever.

[@22:10](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1330.26) \- Denise Shannon  
We did actually, we did actually last year. It just, we didn't have.

[@22:15](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1335.66) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
We did because we were at the hotel.

[@22:17](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1337.36) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah.

[@22:17](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1337.82) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Right, right.

[@22:18](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1338.74) \- Denise Shannon  
So we didn't have minimums that we had to meet or nutrition or anything like that. Yeah. And they just created, like, a unique booking code for us so that it was tracking.  
Right, at a certain rate. So it's trackable and whatnot.

[@22:33](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1353.6) \- Courtney  
So we'll just book, we'll do room blocks just on our own, like, our own accord, I guess. Yep, yep.

[@22:39](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1359.94) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay. And Denise, we can talk about it if we think we, like, I guess that's kind of a short courtyard.

[@22:46](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1366.14) \- Denise Shannon  
I don't know. do. Right, right.

[@22:48](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1368.48) \- Courtney  
Did they give, did they give you a rate? It's 189, which we think is pretty good compared to other cities we're in.

[@22:57](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1377.12) \- Denise Shannon  
But it's small.

[@22:59](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1379.06) \- Courtney  
It's a small. Hotel. So we will probably have to do room blocks at multiple hotels. So the courtyard is walking distance, but the other ones are not.

[@23:10](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1390.26) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. Yeah, I mean, unless we had people that were going to stay on for INN, the majority of our attendees are probably just going to book Monday night, wouldn't you think?

[@23:27](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1407.8) \- Courtney  
Okay. Yeah.

[@23:31](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1411.48) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Stefanie?

[@23:32](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1412.3) \- Courtney  
Yeah. I think we had like 20% overlapping last time.

[@23:35](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1415.62) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, it wasn't that.

[@23:37](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1417.94) \- Courtney  
Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

[@23:41](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1421.84) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay.

[@23:42](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1422.24) \- Courtney  
That was good. Great. They also seem like a great team, quite frankly.

[@23:46](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1426.16) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Like, I really liked. That is actually really important.

[@23:48](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1428.92) \- Courtney  
Yeah. Like, I feel like they're like, they're like streamlined, they're like efficient, but they're also like very, it's not like a hotel environment.  
Where you sort of feel that pressure. So like, you can tell they're trying to hit a goal. Like the Friday Center also has other like programming.  
So this conference center is like one initiative of other things that they do in the community. So it just has a different vibe.  
You know what I mean? And then we can talk later about, but we probably will try to create some, there's a, there's like a space, let me share it with you again.  
So when you're walking into here, it's kind of, you know, it's concrete.  
SCREEN SHARING: Courtney started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1470.855634)

[@24:39](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1479.06) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, is it?

[@24:40](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1480.42) \- Courtney  
You can see.

[@24:43](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1483.26) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Wait, I just see the virtual tour.

[@24:46](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1486.26) \- Courtney  
Oh, I'm sharing the wrong one. Share this one. Okay. Is this?

[@24:52](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1492.94) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay.

[@24:53](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1493.64) \- Courtney  
Oh, yeah, yeah. This is the back entrance, not the front entrance, but you see how like across the street, it's like a parking lot in the lawn.  
But to the side.

[@25:02](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1502.42) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
This looks like GeoGuess, Sergio.

[@25:07](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1507.48) \- Courtney  
To the side, go ahead. On these sides are lawns where they said, like, before they've, you could put lawn games, you can put picnic tables.  
And there'll be trees, like leaves will be in bloom, it'll be spring, so it'll look. Yeah, it'll look beautiful.  
Yeah. Because, I mean, it's just green and trees all around. But we might, you know, at our conference, people don't always go to sessions.  
They want to, like, do a, you know, they want to go grab a coffee. They won't be able to do that here, so we'll put, we'll make an environment out here, probably.  
Okay.

[@25:42](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1542.62) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah. Yeah, do they have, you said they have picnic tables. Do they have, like, Adirondack chairs or anything that we can, you know, maybe create at all?

[@25:50](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1550.18) \- Courtney  
It's like a whole thing. I think we, they would work with some third-party events, or we would, work with some third-party vendor that would have, I'm sure, Adirondack chairs.  
Or however you want to do it. Yeah. But it's not included. Okay. Yeah. So what is included? Just real quick, I'll go through this.  
When it comes to AV, projector screen, mics, the number of mics sort of depends on the room, the size of the room.  
So you'll get like six mics in the auditorium, but these other rooms, you'll get two to four. Um, add on costs is if you want to add mics or if you want to do streaming or recording.

[@26:30](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1590.36) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@26:31](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1591.76) \- Courtney  
Um, and then labor in terms of like the, the auditorium room, there will be someone like working the booth, but in the breakout rooms, they have a floater.

[@26:42](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1602.08) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@26:43](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1603.32) \- Courtney  
And then food and beverage. I sent you the menus, continental breakfast. It includes coffee all day plus AM and PM break.  
So when I was there for the PM break, it was like, like rice, crispy treats and brownies.

[@26:56](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1616.76) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Like it's a real, I'm hungry right now.

[@26:59](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1619.18) \- Courtney  
So that all sounds. Yeah, I'm like, it's really great. And then, but if you want to do a hot breakfast, which we may prefer to do at least for the conference itself, maybe not the pre-day, play to dinners and receptions, those are add-ons.

[@27:14](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1634.58) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@27:16](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1636.56) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Great. Yeah.

[@27:18](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1638.22) \- Courtney  
Okay, cool.

[@27:18](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1638.92) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Sounds good. You'll connect us up with...

[@27:22](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1642.3) \- Courtney  
Yeah, who from your team should I point? Denise.

[@27:26](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1646.28) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Denise? Yep, Denise.

[@27:27](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1647.9) \- Courtney  
Okay. I told them about the whole thing, and they just were, their advice was like, we've done this before, and it can get real weird when we're trying to make this.  
So as long as you guys are clear on who makes a decision, so I think separate is going to be...

[@27:43](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1663.76) \- Denise Shannon  
We agree.

[@27:45](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1665.18) \- Courtney  
Which brings me to registration and pitching.

[@27:48](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1668.54) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yes.

[@27:49](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1669.7) \- Courtney  
I think separate is going to be better too, in the sense that I think it's just going to be more clear for conference goers to not ever get the wrong signal that...

[@28:00](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1680.0) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
That there is one event.

[@28:01](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1681.82) \- Denise Shannon  
Yep.

[@28:02](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1682.54) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
I agree.

[@28:03](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1683.2) \- Courtney  
Yep. That sounds fine to me. But we can obviously link back to one another.

[@28:07](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1687.8) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep. That sounds good. Well, so we'll go ahead and make sure we get that set up on our end and so we can send it to you.  
And we'll publish our pitch form probably. I mean, as soon as we get our contracts done, we can announce the date.

[@28:23](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1703.84) \- Courtney  
Yeah. Our goal is like, we want to like, I'm going to email them today, probably give them a call.  
And see how fast they can send the contract. I think we can put in a deposit before the contract sign.  
I don't know. But our goal is to announce like next Thursday or Friday.

[@28:42](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1722.02) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay. We can aim for the same.

[@28:43](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1723.9) \- Courtney  
Which would be really aggressive.  
ACTION ITEM: Email UNC Friday Center re: supplier setup; start paperwork \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1723.9999)

But it's a little different for us because getting people paid takes some time.

[@28:49](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1729.6) \- Denise Shannon  
But they're a university.

[@28:50](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1730.46) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
They probably understand that.

[@28:52](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1732.72) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah. They would understand that. Right. I'm thinking even if I had their supplier paperwork started. support. Yeah. So, you know, they're potentially in the financial system.

[@29:04](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1744.08) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
That should be enough to make a save the day.

[@29:08](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1748.18) \- Courtney  
I might actually just call them right now to give them a heads up. It's coming. And then make sure they're super clear on what we need and then send the email so it's not sitting in their queue.

[@29:21](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1761.26) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep.

[@29:22](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1762.12) \- Courtney  
Because I'll be out tomorrow. This is my last day this week. But I definitely want to hand them off to you all at least today.

[@29:32](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1772.18) \- Denise Shannon  
today. Yes, that would be great.

[@29:34](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1774.02) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)

Okay, cool. Great.

are. Pitch form preps due in our registration, Joe.

[@29:42](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1782.02) \- Denise Shannon  
can start working on that. And this is just reconfirming it's the week of June 8th.

[@29:48](https://fathom.video/share/vbmm2asJPrKSKAW-X_JaezycMt-rW7-V?timestamp=1788.56) \- Courtney  
The week of June 8th. So you guys will be, yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, no. I have the old proposal in front.  
I'm like, 13th. I'm like, oh, that's the old one. And. Um, I'm just going to triple check since you asked.
