## Best practices

1. **Keep it short**: Announcements appear in a compact banner. Aim for 1-2 sentences max.

2. **One call-to-action**: If including a link, make it clear what action you want people to take.

3. **Use types appropriately**:
   - `info` (teal): General updates, positive news
   - `warning` (amber): Time-sensitive reminders, soft deadlines
   - `urgent` (red): Critical information requiring immediate attention

4. **Dismissible**: Users can dismiss announcements. For critical info that must be seen, also send an email.

5. **One at a time**: Only one announcement shows at a time. The most recent active announcement takes precedence.

6. **Deactivate when done**: After an announcement's purpose is served, toggle it off in the Broadcast tab to keep things tidy.
