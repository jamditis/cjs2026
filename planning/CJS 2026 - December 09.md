## Meeting Purpose

[Finalize CJS 2026 venue, collateral, and sponsorship packages.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=107.0)

## Key Takeaways

* [Venue Budget Crisis: The current venue quote is \~$30k for 1.5 days, far exceeding the budget. A key issue is a $75/person charge for a simple snack break. The team will seek a lower price or find an alternative venue.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=114.0)  
* [Urgent Sponsorship Drive: New packages were approved to raise $15k–$20k before the holidays. Key items include an $8k Dinner Sponsorship (targeting RJI) and a $3k "Mini Safety Kits" package.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=968.0)  
* [Launch Collateral Approved: A simple, artistic graphic featuring the NC state outline was approved for the launch page. This allows for an immediate launch while a more complex 10th-anniversary theme is developed.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=881.0)  
* [Keynote Speaker Search: The search continues for a high-profile speaker. Kara Swisher is a top candidate due to her relevant commentary on journalistic collaboration; Joe will follow up on a potential introduction.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=2135.0)

* [A key cost driver is the $75/person charge for a half-day package, which includes only a snack and auditorium access.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=120.0)  
* [Denise has had two extensive phone calls with the venue contact but has been unable to negotiate the price down.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=183.0)  
* [Action: Denise will send a formal email detailing the required changes to create a written record.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=164.0)

* [The venue's contract is currently with their legal team. Denise will send it to Althea for review to resolve any legal issues in parallel with budget negotiations.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=300.0)

### Sponsorship Packages

* [Goal: Raise $15k–$20k before the holidays. Joe will target Lendfest, RJI, and Lizzie (for a smaller amount) first.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=968.0)  
* [Dinner & Recognition Event: Set at $8,000. This amount is based on Kat's (RJI) typical sponsorship ceiling and would cover most of the event's cost.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=1036.0)  
* [Locally Handcrafted Utensils: Renamed from "Wooden Utensil" to better reflect value.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=1314.0)  
  * [Concept: Pair a handcrafted wooden spoon with a jar of NC barbecue sauce.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=1245.0)

* [Mini Safety Kits: Replaces "Water Bottles" package.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=1486.0)  
  * [Rationale: Aligns with NC's sustainability theme and Amy's recent conversation with IWMF about journalist safety training.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=1486.0)

* [Lanyards: Retained as a low-cost option.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=1444.0)

### Launch Collateral

* [Problem: The complex 10th-anniversary concept is not ready for an immediate launch.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=425.0)

  * [Design: The NC state outline with mountains, using the existing "crayon" style.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=881.0)  
  * [Text: "10th Anniversary," "Raleigh," and "Prepare to Partner."](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=775.0)  
* [Rationale: This provides a clean, artistic look for the launch page and newsletter while the full 10th-anniversary theme is developed as a secondary asset.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=790.0)  
* [Status: The backup landing page (similar to last year's) and newsletter copy are ready. The Eventbrite page is the only missing piece.](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?tab=summary&timestamp=557.0)

Drying my hair off with a towel this morning. What? No, I just, I slept okay, but. Why did you not sleep is because you were just going?  
I think it was the extra dose. I did get to sleep. I David that. I did get to sleep at like 1 a.m., but I don't know, Whit could probably sense my uncomfortable.  
This meeting is being recorded. And he was just like up doing crimes all night. crimes, cat crimes, yeah. just literally just told David, I was like, you should have seen Joe yesterday.  
He went like this and took a pill and he was like, wait a second. I was oh no. Yeah, double dosed myself.  
So Stephanie had to do it with a fallout. He was like, I told Denise. was like, brrrr. Yeah, and then what about this?  
And you know what, this, why, why, why, why, why, why? Yeah. Like four screens going, he had music going, he's talking, he's building.  
I was double fidgeting. And then maybe we could do this. And then I'm thinking about for the website. It's insufferable.  
She's a veteran. No, I'm a veteran at that. It's totally fine. dealing with that, yeah. Medal of Honor there.  
Yeah, I have to yell out here. No, it's good, though. mean, you – yeah, Delaney. You've got a lot done.  
You've got a lot done. You've got a lot done, yeah. It's like moving. Joe, just before we get started, I'm going to send Kenny an email.  
Just let him know I won't be on the call. For later. Yep, works for me. Yep. Yep, I'm prepping.  
I'm prepping all that. I'm also just putting some final touches on our launch page, so I'm sort of going double here.

[@1:46](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=106.68) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@1:47](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=107.66) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay, so Denise, update us. Wait, was that Amy that just came in?

[@1:51](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=111.12) \- Amy Maestas  
Yes, okay, great. Yeah, I'm here.

[@1:52](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=112.6) \- Joe Amditis  
Awesome.

[@1:53](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=113.18) \- Denise Shannon  
Morning, morning, morning.

[@1:54](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=114.18) \- Joe Amditis  
All right, Denise, what's the deal?

[@2:00](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=120.0) \- Denise Shannon  
Morgan on the changes that we requested, we're still way above, way above budget.

[@2:07](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=127.94) \- Joe Amditis  
Yikes. Why?

[@2:13](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=133.86) \- Denise Shannon  
Well, for example, we switched to a half day package on Monday, which I thought was going to make a huge difference.  
And he's still charging us $75 a person.

[@2:27](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=147.58) \- Joe Amditis  
What a great guy. $75 a person for a snack.  
ACTION ITEM: Email Morgan re: schedule/budget edits; then call Courtney to confirm Thu announcement \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=153.9999)

[@2:32](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=152.98) \- Denise Shannon  
Right. Right. For a snack and, you know, to sit in the auditorium. So.

[@2:40](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=160.4) \- Joe Amditis  
Plus the fans using the space. Yeah.

[@2:43](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=163.34) \- Denise Shannon  
Right. Right. So we're still worlds apart, but I'm going to keep, I don't, I'm going to send it all in an email because we've had a couple of, you know, phone calls.  
try Thank-bye. And he's just still not getting it.

[@3:02](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=182.58) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. I was going to say, you've talked to him on the phone.

[@3:05](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=185.9) \- Denise Shannon  
Like, yes, two extensive phone calls now, which definitely seems what, you know, his preference, because that's what Courtney calls him.  
But he's not getting the edits down the way we need the schedule to be structured and slash some money off of this.  
So that's where we're at.

[@3:30](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=210.0) \- Joe Amditis  
Should we, like, I don't know what to do, like, I mean, come to an agreement to get this to be more affordable.

[@3:43](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=223.04) \- Denise Shannon  
Right. I think we probably need to give it a day or two. I'll hang Courtney again to see where they are at, if they feel that they're going to be able to announce on Thursday.  
And if we can't come to an agreement, then we're going to have to look for an alternative. Because we can't, you know, we can't pay $30,000 for a day and a half.

[@4:19](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=259.54) \- Joe Amditis  
No.

[@4:20](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=260.54) \- Denise Shannon  
And still put on a lovely dinner without, you know, some thunder coming in and saving us.

[@4:28](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=268.9) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah.

[@4:29](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=269.58) \- Denise Shannon  
But that's not, you know, but that's not the way that we work. We, you know, put on this conference.  
We keep the ticket prices low. We are not looking for it to be a revenue generator, but we also can't, you know, exhaust all of our reserves because they happen to be expensive.

[@4:48](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=288.08) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah.

[@4:52](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=292.54) \- Denise Shannon  
So I wish I had more positive news, but I don't yet.

[@4:58](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=298.58) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay. Okay. I'm just, Courtney said that they haven't resolved, I just posted in Slack, their contract added to their legal team.  
ACTION ITEM: Email Althea venue contract for legal review \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=306.9999)

[@5:06](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=306.94) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay, so they're in legal. Yeah. Okay. Well, I just want something that I can give to legal, so.

[@5:15](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=315.0) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. Should we, should we pass that contract on to Althea so that we can resolve the legal, any legal issues before, if we are able to get the money resolved?

[@5:34](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=334.08) \- Denise Shannon  
I can do that, sure.

[@5:35](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=335.88) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay.

[@5:37](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=337.38) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, because it's only, like, three pages, they're, yeah, like, three or four pages, they're legal. Terms conditions. Okay.

[@5:54](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=354.46) \- Joe Amditis  
Because we're still looking at dinner elsewhere, right?

[@5:57](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=357.18) \- Denise Shannon  
Yes. Mm-hmm. Yep.

[@6:10](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=370.14) \- Joe Amditis  
$75 a person for coffee and a snack. Get out of here. Okay.

[@6:17](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=377.66) \- Denise Shannon  
Well, Joe, how big is your mom's backyard?

[@6:20](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=380.54) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, right? Not that big. Maybe 25, 30 people, but the best people. I feel like Stan could find a place for us.  
Stan's backyard, on the other hand, is a health and safety hazard, but it could fit those people, so.

[@6:36](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=396.68) \- Denise Shannon  
But we'd have to bust them out to the boonies because he's like in the mountains, right?

[@6:41](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=401.88) \- Joe Amditis  
You may get like, you know, staph infection or something and maybe get shot, but that's North Carolina, baby. Maybe get shot.  
Right.

[@6:50](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=410.32) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@6:52](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=412.3) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay. Well, let's just move forward. So, Joe, do you want... Do to talk about collateral or should we go to sponsorships?  
Are you prepared to talk about collateral, like website? I mean, I have stuff, but with the uncertainty, I kind of didn't lean in as hard as I, I mean, I'm going to do that today, but, you know, I wasn't sure if we were doing it.  
So in this economy right now, you know, there's a lot going on. Do you want to show you what I have?  
I mean. It's still compiling, but you want me to show you what I have? I, I, I went through and I've been really trying to focus on the 10 year.  
I mean, I am making facetious, but I have done work on this, but, um, I'm leaning into the 10 year anniversary.  
So I brought, that was a lot of words to say. didn't do it yet. Look, you know, there's a lot of economic and political factors at play here.  
Um, but, um, I was focusing on the 10 year anniversary. So I built an entire app yesterday. I did, but, um, that was for, it's actually, we're going to use that for the summit.  
We're going to use discord for. The summit. No, I pulled all of the schedules from the last 10 years.  
The only one I couldn't find that I just observed on my backlog here is the 2017 one, the original one, because I don't think we necessarily had a, we didn't have a collaborative journalism site until 2018\.  
Um, but, um, I'm, I'm basically, I'm, I'm trying to do it like, uh, like a journey through the years kind of a thing.  
Um, uh, not, nothing too crazy, just like the evolution of, you know, the collaborative journalism summit with now we're in Raleigh.  
And we talked about the roadmap kind of a thing. Um, my inspiration was the little like child's, uh, city town rug kind of a thing with the green rug with the stuff.  
So I have a few like sketches and draft illustrations for that, but I also have the regular prepare to partner page, uh, prepped and ready to go as a backup.  
So I'm trying to be a little more ambitious with the 10th anniversary stuff, but if we needed to launch today, I have the website, the landing page ready to go.  
It just looks exactly like last year's landing page, you know, Raleigh. 126, prepare to partner kind of a thing.  
So, I mean, we can look at that, but it's literally the exact same thing. Yeah. So the collateral that, I mean, I would like to have a North Carolina thing ready to go.  
ACTION ITEM: Create Eventbrite for CJS 2026 registration \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=553.9999)  
Yeah. I mean, we have a newsletter draft for announcing, you know, the save the date slash registration is open.  
The thing we don't have is the Eventbrite yet. So I can work on that today. But the collateral as far as the copy, you know, logo at the top kind of a thing.  
Yeah. I mean, that's ready to go in like within an hour. Could we, though, do it, like get it prepped with the basic North Carolina imagery?  
Yeah. No, I mean, that's what I'm saying. That's what I have. Great. Okay. Do you want that like? That list that I just put in Slack, that's what we need.  
Hold on. Where are you? Here you go. Oh, just that. Yeah, that's the list of stuff we need. I'm working on the spot.  
sponsorship form, which we'll talk about next. And the 10th anniversary poster doesn't have to be done now. I saw what you were working on with that, like that.  
Yeah, you're talking about something like this in the chat, in the Zoom chat, like this at the top of the page and things like that.  
I mean, I'm talking about the, remember how you were drawing like North Carolina, you showed me some of the North Carolina.  
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, that stuff is all like concept work, though. That's not, that's it. I don't want to, we're not going to use the AI art, though, right?  
Or no? Um, for what? Last time I did that was, was Detroit, and I look back on it, and I hate it, so.  
Uh, for the, no, I, I was thinking, okay, so yes, what, what you have in the chat, we could use to launch.  
Yeah, that's my baseline backup on it, like we have to go today, kind of thing. But, but I do think that we could just use some of the basic, like, like that one very simple graphic with like, just the outline of even North Carolina.  
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I know what you're talking about. Some that simple stuff, yeah. Because remember how you had that nice-looking Colorado background, and we had a nice-looking Detroit background?  
Well, yeah, the Detroit one – so, yes, I hear you, and I can do that. The Detroit one was AI.  
The Denver one, I whipped open – cracked open the old Photoshop because I hated – I didn't like how using the AI one made me feel in 2023 or whatever it was.  
So, I mean, I don't really care if it's AI. I don't know. I know, but I do, and I'm the one designing it, and I know that makes me – takes longer, but – Is there a way to just update our basic graphic that somehow, you know, doesn't screen 10th anniversary, but has the 10 – Yeah, I can slap a 10-year – a 10, like, you know, 10 on the thing.  
I mean, on the – what's it called? The graphic Yes. A hundred percent. Stefanie, you're talking about this one, right?  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=724.318119)  
You're talking about, hold on. You're talking about where to go. Something like this kind of a thing, right? Yeah.  
But there was a different one. Hold on. was a different one. Yeah. Something like that. And then can we have a little, a little, like, a little.  
That was the. This is the concept. Yeah. That, that looked, that's coming along and that, that looked. That's what the barbecue sauce that looks like a coffee cup.  
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Um, that's look that that's getting there. But, um, I was thinking of something that was, go back to that for a second.  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=761.935904)  
Okay. That was maybe. That's maybe just even the blue. Just the blue, like. Just without all the stuff on it.  
Like, something even super simple like that for the background. 10th anniversary here, Raleigh prepared a partner down here? That's right, something like that.  
little CJS logo where Raleigh is? Something like that, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think what you have, we want to develop that out more, and maybe that could be a lean image.

[@13:21](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=801.421) \- Denise Shannon  
Don't ditch that.

[@13:23](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=803.201) \- Joe Amditis  
No, I'm not.

[@13:23](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=803.981) \- Denise Shannon  
I agree.

[@13:25](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=805.801) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay. But I think that it's probably just a little too busy. I got you. You're at the top of all the collateral, that's all.  
Yeah. Can do. Whoa. You're not going to make it blue, state that color blue, though. No, of course not.  
I would never make it Tar Heel blue.

[@13:43](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=823.841) \- Denise Shannon  
No, I just mean like. That's like a different blue. That's not Tar Heel blue.

[@13:48](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=828.101) \- Joe Amditis  
Go back up to the. Just take that exact thing. With only the state. Yeah, let me just take this image.  
ACTION ITEM: Produce NC-state-only graphic w/ mountains; add 10th-anniversary banner; share w/ Denise \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=841.9999)  
With only the state. you. It's a, well, it's, it's okay. I see what you're saying. It's baked in. Like that is, that's a PNG that I exported.  
So I will do that. I will do that. But this is an Illustrator and Photoshop file that has been exported and brought into Canva.  
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So if you could go back to the Illustrator file and just take off everything except the state with the mountains.  
Yeah. That would, that would be perfect. Yeah. This is Tar Heel blue, by the way, just so you know, where'd it go?  
This color? I didn't know that was a color. I'm sorry. It is the state color.

[@14:29](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=869.802) \- Denise Shannon  
It is that color?

[@14:31](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=871.502) \- Joe Amditis  
It is that color.

[@14:32](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=872.782) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. I thought it was a little lighter.

[@14:35](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=875.162) \- Joe Amditis  
just do like a nod to blue? Why is this coming off? I don't know why this is coming off as just gray.  
But do we want to use the official Tar Heel blue kind of thing or do blue in general? No.  
Just use the state that you have with the mountains and the, it looks like it's colored with crayons. Got it.  
Okay. I will do that. Just that. That looks pretty. And it looks artistic and. Got it. Okay. And then what you can do is then.  
In other collateral, can we can use that image. And so as a motif. Yeah. Yes. OK. Yeah. So basically.  
OK. So that that's basically where I was at. Like if we are we haven't decided even on the actual color yet, that's that's sort of where not to blame everyone except for myself, but that's sort of where I'm at in terms of, you know, the hesitancy.  
So if we're happy with moving forward with something like that. I really like that. I think that would be fantastic.  
Just that background, that that background with, you know, a little 10th anniversary flag thing or a little banner or a little I don't know, a little something that's kind of snuck in the corner.  
Yep. Yep. I got it. That's right. Perfect. I have my I have my orders. I will. I'll get this to you.  
I'll get you something to look at today. OK. And then the 10th anniversary poster and the other like the more.  
Developed North Carolina stuff will develop or you'll work on that in the coming weeks. Yep. Perfect. Okay, great. Weeks.  
Okay. All right. So let's go to sponsorships then if that's okay. I really do want to get this in front of people ASAP because I talked a little bit more with Shannon Bowen too.  
SCREEN SHARING: Stefanie started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=975.003729)  
And she does think that even though Lizzie told me no last year, Lizzie basically told me she'll never give me money for the summit in a very kind way.  
Shannon and Lizzie don't have a great relationship because they just don't see eye to eye on things and they don't work together like we work with the consortium here.  
But she said that she has had success convincing Lizzie to give small amounts. So she's like, if you just go in and ask for $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, she goes, I bet you'll get it.  
So I want to do that and I want to get money out of RJI so we can at least maybe secure $15,000 to $20,000 before we...  
Break for the holidays, if not more than that. So I left all the top of the packages the same right now, which is presenting travel scholarships, day one or day two, and sponsored sessions.  
And then here's the more fun ones. So the Dinner and Recognition event, that's Monday. Denise, I have this at 8,000 now.

[@17:24](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1044.64) \- Denise Shannon  
What do you think about that? Okay. In like targeting RJI again, or?

[@17:32](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1052.66) \- Joe Amditis  
No, just the dollar amount.

[@17:34](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1054.44) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@17:35](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1055.56) \- Joe Amditis  
That's about what Kat has told me was her ceiling in the past. She gives more money to Lion and INN.  
You better not. God damn it, do you have a bug? He is such a disgusting cat. He brings cave crickets up from the basement all the time.

[@17:52](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1072.24) \- Amy Maestas  
I mean, isn't that the whole purpose of him being alive?

[@17:55](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1075.82) \- Joe Amditis  
He's supposed to kill them and leave them where they are. He's not supposed to. He brings them. He brings them upstairs alive and then plays with them until they're dead.

[@18:02](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1082.9) \- Amy Maestas  
And then I find legs and heads.

[@18:04](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1084.78) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh, gross. Cave crickets. It's nasty.

[@18:08](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1088.1) \- Denise Shannon  
Well, if you lived here, they would play with frogs and geckos and tear them apart.

[@18:15](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1095.96) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh, God.

[@18:16](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1096.76) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. I'll take the Be happy it's only bugs.

[@18:19](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1099.64) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah.

[@18:20](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1100.16) \- Denise Shannon  
It's fine.

[@18:20](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1100.72) \- Joe Amditis  
Yes.

[@18:21](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1101.88) \- Denise Shannon  
Yes. Because that would cover probably not all the expenses, but close to.

[@18:28](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1108.84) \- Joe Amditis  
Close. Yeah. And I do think that Kat will sponsor this one. And I'd like to get her locked down, too, because that way that we'd have, you know, at least those two.  
Okay. So this is how I, so are we still want to look at barbecue sauce? Yes, definitely. I just called it wooden utensil because, Joe, I think, like, we want to pursue that.  
woodcrafts. Let's call it woodcrafts. Whatever they, whatever they want, you want to order. don't know if it's spoons or utensils or whatever we're, whatever we're ordering.

[@18:58](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1138.94) \- Denise Shannon  
I don't know. Yeah, Yes. You're don't

[@19:00](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1140.68) \- Joe Amditis  
Something wood. I know, but I can't just say sponsor barbecue sauce and wood.

[@19:06](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1146.26) \- Denise Shannon  
Something like handcrafted or something that elevates wood. Handcrafted woodworking. Not woodworking.

[@19:19](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1159.48) \- Joe Amditis  
Handcrafted. Trinkets. What's wrong with the pencil? that seem to you? It makes it seem like we're going to get a fork and a spoon.  
Are we doing that? Well, I mean, if you're giving someone barbecue sauce, I really feel like we need true.  
Yeah. Yes, that's a good point.

[@19:32](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1172.38) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah. No, I don't have a problem with utensil. Fine by me. I just was trying to, you know, come up with a good adjective.  
ACTION ITEM: Schedule call w/ Denise \+ Joe's brother re: wooden sporks; then update sponsorship form \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1179.9999)

[@19:40](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1180.26) \- Joe Amditis  
I mean, I guess I, like, can we just find out how much it would cost to get spoons? And we just say spoon.  
Okay. Because what else would you give someone? I mean, I would want to ask them what they could do.  
I'll get, I can get them on a call with the two of us today, if you want. Oh, yeah, Denise.  
Or the three of us, sorry, yeah. Yeah, I mean, it could be you and Denise and your brother, too.  
Like, I don't have to know how to join just because I'm going to be out with William this afternoon.  
But I guess my point is, is like, what else would you give someone barbecue sauce if it's not a spoon?

[@20:16](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1216.98) \- Denise Shannon  
Right.

[@20:17](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1217.54) \- Joe Amditis  
No, that's true. It has to be a spoon, right? You're not going to give them barbecue sauce and a small wooden fork.  
True. I just never thought, but for some reason, my brain just didn't connect the idea of those two things going together.  
Yeah, I don't like, I'm just thinking eating barbecue sauce, but I guess that's, that's totally fair.

[@20:41](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1241.3) \- Amy Maestas  
Like a spoon for people to eat it?

[@20:45](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1245.18) \- Joe Amditis  
No, to spoon it, like, it's going to be a jar of barbecue sauce. And we wanted to give people, Joe's brother's company is based there and he makes like really nice wooden, handcrafted wooden.  
So it gave us the idea of why don't we tie like a nice little wooden spoon to the jar of barbecue sauce.

[@21:09](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1269.6) \- Amy Maestas  
gotcha, gotcha. That's cool.

[@21:12](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1272.32) \- Joe Amditis  
My other question is, is that a problem if we actually contract with Joe's brother's company? That's what I was wondering.  
I was worried about that because it sounds way worse when you say it like that as opposed to, yeah, my brother's down there in North Carolina.  
He's a local vendor. makes wood stuff. And then I'm like, like the brother is bad. So we'd have to do, would we have to do some kind of bid process or have we had, do we have to do that with other vendors?

[@21:36](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1296.36) \- Amy Maestas  
You mean per university rules?

[@21:38](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1298.68) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. Well, it's the rules that pertain to us really, if it's university or otherwise, I would assume it's university.  
Yeah. I mean, it's going to be a low dollar amount. So we don't have to do bids. I just.

[@21:48](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1308.52) \- Denise Shannon  
Especially if, you know, if, if it's being paid for with a sponsorship, we don't at all. I think we have to change the name altogether, though.

[@21:58](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1318.2) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay.

[@21:59](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1319.58) \- Denise Shannon  
I think. think we have to come up with some, like, North Carolina Appalachian woodworking and just explain in the description what we're giving them.  
Like, if I read that, do I want to pay $5,000 for barbecue sauce?

[@22:17](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1337.76) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. True. Yep. Yeah. We can also include some images, I guess, that might help. But yeah, I see your point.  
Yeah. Yeah. Like a welcome kit? A Southern Hospitality package. A Southern Charm package. Now we're really starting to sound like carpetbaggers.  
Delaney, Amy, any better ideas? We're treading water here.

[@22:54](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1374.06) \- Delaney Butler  
I don't Andy Cohen suing us, so I'm against Southern Charm, but...

[@22:57](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1377.92) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh, that... Oh, right. The show. That's right. ... My sister-in-law made me watch some of that, or allowed me to watch some of that, let me just say, because it is a treat.  
Welcome gifts?

[@23:15](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1395.82) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, let's leave gift for...

[@23:21](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1401.02) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay.

[@23:22](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1402.26) \- Denise Shannon  
Good moment.

[@23:26](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1406.5) \- Joe Amditis  
And we'll just call it locally handcrafted wooden utensils for now.

[@23:37](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1417.96) \- Amy Maestas  
I mean, we could give people sporks and tell them that's a collaboration between forks and spoons.

[@23:43](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1423.98) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh, that's amazing. There we go.

[@23:47](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1427.24) \- Denise Shannon  
Done.

[@23:48](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1428.4) \- Joe Amditis  
Sporks. Done. There we go. Sporks. That's beautiful. it. I love it. That is incredible. Because a spork is very useful.

[@23:59](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1439.16) \- Amy Maestas  
Totally. Totally useful.

[@24:01](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1441.68) \- Joe Amditis  
It is an underrated utensil. So what else do we want to do then? I just left water bottles, treats, and lanyards.

[@24:08](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1448.54) \- Denise Shannon  
We'll leave lanyards because that's easy.

[@24:11](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1451.1) \- Joe Amditis  
Definitely.

[@24:11](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1451.66) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah. A couple people wanted that last year. So it makes me think, like, do we need to have a couple lower ends?

[@24:22](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1462.36) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah.

[@24:23](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1463.78) \- Denise Shannon  
Actually, if we get them from a local vendor, because there were a few bakeries on that made-in-NC list, maybe we could consider the vendor as an in-kind and get a, you know, if we can negotiate a better price.

[@24:44](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1484.62) \- Joe Amditis  
Sounds good. So the water bottles, we had put this on last year for Colorado because of altitude. Right. But no one needs to be hydrated in North Carolina.

[@24:56](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1496.2) \- Denise Shannon  
No. No. I mean, no one needs to be hydrated, but so much. Most what I read, you know, about North Carolina in general is sustainability.

[@25:06](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1506.96) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay.

[@25:10](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1510.2) \- Denise Shannon  
So do I think it should be $3,000 for water bottles? No, but.

[@25:19](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1519.24) \- Amy Maestas  
Oh, I had put, I mean, I know we're trying to do thematic gifts based on North Carolina, but also.  
That given, given, and I don't know that we necessarily, the summit captures a lot of investigative journalists who are in danger, but safety items, you know, things that are useful, like air tags or tiles or something like that, which are probably even in purchased in bulk are probably still kind of expensive, but whistles and other things.

[@25:53](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1553.86) \- Joe Amditis  
Well, you all know, because you had those go bags that, um. Yep, yep.

[@25:59](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1559.26) \- Amy Maestas  
But. That just arose from my conversation with IWMF last week, who wants to do safety training, partner with us to do safety training for journalists.

[@26:14](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1574.36) \- Joe Amditis  
I think that's not a bad idea.

[@26:18](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1578.84) \- Denise Shannon  
Right, especially since we had the team from, you know, that we're dealing with, the North Carolina.

[@26:30](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1590.28) \- Amy Maestas  
Disaster last year. Yep, yep, hurricanes and that sort of stuff. I mean, if we really wanted to make it a theme, could buy, get tiles or air tags and have Bless Your Heart engraved on them.

[@26:42](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1602.62) \- Joe Amditis  
That would be a very good one. Good luck as you die in a flood. Should we just call the mini safety kits for now?

[@26:54](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1614.22) \- Denise Shannon  
Is that because we can't do a... That's fine. Yeah, I mean, we can't do the $300 version.

[@26:58](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1618.94) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah, I mean, it's just a...

[@27:00](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1620.0) \- Denise Shannon  
I mean, plastic whistles are probably cheap. Oh, yeah.

[@27:05](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1625.94) \- Joe Amditis  
Absolutely. I mean, you can also do like a first aid kit. Yes, exactly.

[@27:10](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1630.14) \- Amy Maestas  
of other little things. Yeah, can get first aid kits pretty small and pretty, I think, affordable and bulk. I live in the land of prepper, so I know all the things that are available out there.

[@27:28](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1648.34) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, there's ones that basically just have Band-Aids and alcohol wipes, and then a little bit more substantial.

[@27:43](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1663.56) \- Amy Maestas  
And depending on how it's packaged to, like, if you're thinking about something journalists can carry on the job, first aid is, which is something that could be branded as pencils, you know, pens stop working.  
King, when you're out, I don't know, I'm dating myself, journalists don't take notes in a notepad anymore, I'm totally dating myself, like, you know, pencils.  
No, but we did hear that the waterproof notebooks were really well received, and to your point, the pencil versus the And pencils, because, you know, I learned this very young as a reporter, you go out and pens freeze, ink freezes, so, you know, you need pencils for something you waterproof notebooks are so useful, and yet, also a sensory nightmare to me, I hate the way the waxed paper feels.

[@28:39](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1719.98) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, we bought, I forget what the kit we bought was, an art kit, but ours came with a waterproof.

[@28:47](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1727.54) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, I have it in. And writing utensils. Saved in Amazon, so we can pull that up and play around.

[@28:54](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1734.08) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay. All right, this is, this is William's, uh, next swimming class. man.,000 letsAll Bye. Bye Bye Water stamina. All right.  
Where were we? were we? Here we go. Okay. So we can, we can keep going on that. Is $3,000 going to be enough?  
That'd probably just cover the cost of it. I would imagine if we do a good kit because the, like the mini first aid, there'll probably be five to 600 bucks.

[@29:24](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1764.2) \- Denise Shannon

[@29:42](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1782.56) \- Joe Amditis  
Like 200?

[@29:43](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1783.46) \- Amy Maestas  
We usually order 100 of these things. Oh, okay. Cause not everybody takes them.

[@29:47](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1787.56) \- Joe Amditis

Yeah.

[@30:03](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1803.96) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay, so let's lock in with this.

[@30:08](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1808.24) \- Amy Maestas  
Like I just saw, I just Googled mini first aid kits that come in tins, and you get a pack of 50 of them for $160.

[@30:17](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1817.84) \- Joe Amditis  
So, you know, to get 100 of them, and that's what, more than $300. Perfect. Okay, great. Okay, let me then start sending this to a couple of people.  
Denise, let me know if there's anything you need us to do with terms of getting an Yeah, as soon as we finish, I'm going to, I'm going to reach out to him again.

I didn't even know. I had to Google them, and I wish I hadn't.

[@31:04](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1864.4) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah, I didn't know the lore, and yeah, so anyway.

[@31:12](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1872.8) \- Joe Amditis  
No, there's lore, but I mean, he's a news guy. That's kind of like the thing.

[@31:23](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1883.2) \- Amy Maestas  
Didn't his wife both work in television news? I think maybe not.

Yeah. I mean, he was at WCNC, I think, for a while.

[@31:30](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1890.96) \- Amy Maestas

[@31:39](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1899.66) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. Yeah, they live in Raleigh. Their background is in broadcast journalism, and then they switch to basically, they're like parent influencers.  
They make fun of parent stuff, but they're like Christian-leaning and a little conservative-leaning. Yeah. And they just do like stupid skits.

[@31:59](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1919.78) \- Amy Maestas  
Apparently. Yeah. Certainly there was some controversy about their family values or whatever infidelity. I don't know. Those people are messy.  
Sorry, don't be judgmental, but you get a big audience like that and you start espousing, like, we know how to tell you to live your lives and those are the messiest people.

[@32:19](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1939.18) \- Delaney Butler  
Wow. Yeah. If there were someone like that without the weird problematic package, you know what I mean? Like, because I was like, oh, wait, like, he has a news background and he's like a creator.  
He lives in Raleigh. And then I was like, oh, wait.

[@32:37](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1957.94) \- Joe Amditis

Oh, no. No. Okay. We don't have enough time for this meeting today because I got all the deets on that.  
I love the Utah influencer.

[@32:55](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1975.06) \- Joe Amditis

I will say, though, I will just say on this, Suzanne. And also said that Rose Hoban would probably have ideas for a keynote because, you know, she's outside.  
That's what I can say.

[@33:16](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1996.7) \- Joe Amditis  
I do not believe I've talked to her for a while.

[@33:19](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=1999.48) \- Delaney Butler  
I haven't either. The last time I talked to her, I mean, like, her name keeps coming up with the folks in Wilmington.  
But, yeah, the last time I talked to her, Liza and I had, like, an argument with her because she was not an argument.  
She was like, my reporter is going on her honeymoon. And so, like, we have to get this project started.  
This was, like, an SJN project. And Liza was like, like, I do not care about her reporter's honeymoon.

[@33:46](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2026.64) \- Joe Amditis  
And I was like, I think that's fair. But don't say that to her. Yeah, don't say that.

[@33:50](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2030.36) \- Delaney Butler  
Is she still at Carolina Health News or did she retire?

No, she is still there.

[@33:54](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2034.6) \- Delaney Butler

Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. Yeah, we got to keep thinking about this. But I think that's enough for today.  
We got to get this contract locked in. I can't, I also can't ask the keynote speaker to come to UNC before we know we're going to be.  
Okay. So I'm going to send the sponsorship to at least three sponsors who I know will probably lock in.  
Like Lendfest always sponsors us. RJI almost always sponsors us. And I'm going to try to get money out of Lizzie just to get started.  
And then once we have this hopefully locked in next week, by the end of this week, rather, I'll send it to some more folks.  
Yeah.

[@34:53](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2093.68) \- Denise Shannon

Yeah, I've been trying to think about. I know. Do you all know Tressie McMillan Cottom, the sociology professor at UNC Chapel Hill?

[@35:16](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2116.77) \- Joe Amditis  
No.

[@35:17](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2117.58) \- Amy Maestas  
I've been trying to think of like how we could get her to talk, you know, the intersection of sociology and collaborative journalism.  
She's, she's a huge, she'd be a huge straw. She's excellent, but it's a little bit of a stretch for a sociology professor that she is at Chapel Hill.  
And, you know, Kara Swisher's always.

[@35:38](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2138.77) \- Joe Amditis  
I really like the Kara Swisher idea.

[@35:40](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2140.83) \- Amy Maestas

Yeah, we were. Oh, yeah, I was. Well, I was going to ask.

[@36:00](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2160.77) \- Joe Amditis

Okay.

[@36:11](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2171.33) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, that's what, when you search Google, that's what you find, is that she doesn't have a speaking fee.

[@36:16](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2176.57) \- Amy Maestas  
There's nothing publicly posted. Yeah, she does. She probably just does it based off of how much she wants to charge based on what the ask is.

[@36:27](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2187.95) \- Amy Maestas  
Unlike her counterpart, Scott Galloway, who the other day in their podcast was bragging that he doesn't charge for, he, oh, he's, his method is he either charges an exorbitant amount so people don't ask or he does it for free.  
And that's his way. Scott Galloway, she, Kara and Scott Galloway do a podcast together.

Yeah.

[@37:12](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2232.53) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah.

[@37:16](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2236.13) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. With Nicole Hannah-Jones, I don't, I mean, she's clearly an incredible speaker and I'd love to have her and she's got local ties to UNC.  
I don't know that how I would connect her to collaborative journalism. I just haven't seen anything that she's written or talked about that plays in that space at all.

[@37:35](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2255.09) \- Denise Shannon  
I didn't know if we were looking for someone who is really high profile that.

[@37:41](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2261.25) \- Joe Amditis  
We are. Yeah.

[@37:42](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2262.75) \- Denise Shannon  
But that we were necessarily buying it into collaboration or just someone who's going to be really dynamic.

[@37:49](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2269.77) \- Joe Amditis  
Totally. Yes. It's kind of 60-40 for me. 70-30. 6-7 as the kids say. As I say, constantly in my house, I'm ruining it.  
That's for my kids, because I say it all the time. That's what our elves did today. Elf and squirrel are working on their math homework, and their math homework was all six plus seven.  
The kid's got a kick in it.

[@38:12](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2292.25) \- Amy Maestas  
But wait, when you're saying it, are you saying 67, or are you saying six, seven?

[@38:16](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2296.77) \- Joe Amditis  
You have to go six, seven.

[@38:18](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2298.41) \- Amy Maestas  
Oh, okay.

[@38:18](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2298.93) \- Joe Amditis  
I thought you were saying to them 67\.

[@38:21](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2301.15) \- Amy Maestas  
I'm like, well, no wonder you're ruining it.

[@38:22](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2302.81) \- Joe Amditis  
You're getting it wrong.

[@38:23](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2303.81) \- Amy Maestas  
No. Okay. All right. You're doing it right.

[@38:26](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2306.07) \- Joe Amditis  
You're doing it right. I'm doing it totally right, yes. I watched a really good video last night, actually, that broke down how this came about, because I didn't know the background of the Skrilla song, and the basketball player who's six, seven, and how that got put together.  
Did you know that, Joe? You're making a face at me. Am I the lady here? Yeah. It also ties back to, apparently, a gang war in either Philly or Chicago.  
can't remember which one. My friend Devin was- Does it? Because I thought it- I thought had to do What with the code, like something 6-7 being- There's so many.  
Once it becomes a meme, you can really, you kind of lose the ability to trace it back. But the Skrilla song refers to 67th Street in Philly.  
Philly, yeah. He's the king of Kensington or something like that. He calls himself. Anyway, yeah. Yeah, anyway. Anyway, this is a classic, this is a classic CJS planning.  
This is great. It's classic. We're getting, we're getting places. But anyway, a high profile dynamic speaker, yes. But we just got to have something to connect them.  
Like Kara Swisher, our 80 video connection is that she has talked recently on her podcast, Amy told us about journalists working together.  
So we'd want to have her expand on that. And she can jump off into a lot of other topics, but just touch it on it is like all we need.

[@39:59](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2399.45) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah, she was on a podcast with Jessica Yellen, News Not Noise.

[@40:05](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2405.17) \- Joe Amditis  
Yellen, that's right, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, um, let's wrap, um, and go forth and lock this venue down.

[@40:17](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2417.55) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@40:18](https://fathom.video/share/9eWfDgtvJLh3t1FyVeyyjPBDAnJUycXn?timestamp=2418.61) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay, cool. All right, thank you all. Talk to you later.
