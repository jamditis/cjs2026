**Pittsburgh talking points to weave into messaging:**
- Hub of innovative local journalism (PublicSource, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette transformation)

- Accessible location for East Coast and Midwest attendees
- Vibrant food and arts scene for evening events
- "City of Bridges" metaphor = connecting communities
