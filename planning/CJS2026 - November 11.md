[@0:33](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=33.24) \- Stefanie Murray  
Delaney and Amy, yesterday, you should have seen me. I had this, like, epic argument with Chris Daggett, the consortium director, over the he's trying to pull on us.  
And I have not been this angry at someone in probably about 11 years.

[@0:54](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=54.22) \- Amy Maestas

I like me to do you.

[@1:11](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=71.14) \- Stefanie Murray  
It's just an emotional response.

[@1:13](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=73.32) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
That's why I hate getting angry. I literally walked in like a minute and a half before disaster.

[@1:18](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=78.08) \- Stefanie Murray  
He walked in the door and I hung up the phone like a minute later and I burst into tears and Joe's looking at me like, what?

[@1:26](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=86.0) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
She didn't even just hang up the phone. She had to hang up on Chris. She told Chris, she was like, Chris, I'm going to end this call now before I say something I regret.  
And then she hung up the phone and I, and I sit down and I look over and she's just beside herself.  
And all I could think of to say was just take a beat.

[@1:41](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=101.28) \- Stefanie Murray  
Oh, she was like, he was like, like, I was like, yeah, it was, it was, I've never seen it like that.

[@1:48](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=108.58) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Chris.

[@1:49](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=109.68) \- Stefanie Murray  
Delaney, I, I, it makes me feel better to know, to be in community with someone else who that happened to.

[@1:55](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=115.4) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah, no, that is why I hate getting angry in front of you.

[@2:04](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=124.42) \- Delaney Butler  
It just. I know.

[@2:06](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=126.0) \- Stefanie Murray  
It's like, you can't. It's not controllable.

[@2:08](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=128.46) \- Delaney Butler  
It's not. That's not.

[@2:19](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=139.08) \- Stefanie Murray  
The consortium.

[@2:20](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=140.38) \- Amy Maestas  
Is he the new guy?

[@2:21](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=141.48) \- Stefanie Murray  
Is he the new guy?

[@2:22](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=142.44) \- Amy Maestas  
No.

[@2:23](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=143.26) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, okay. He's the old guy. Heavy on that.

[@2:27](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=147.5) \- Stefanie Murray  
No.

[@2:28](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=148.96) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
No, I mean, like, he was there from the beginning. Oh, no, no, not like that.

[@2:31](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=151.76) \- Stefanie Murray  
Although he is old. I mean, like, he is the OG guy from the beginning of the consortium. I thought you were saying because.

[@2:36](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=156.66) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I literally, I should, it's funny. I didn't even think to make that.

[@2:39](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=159.22) \- Stefanie Murray  
But yes, he's also elderly, but yes. Yeah, he's, so that, you know, because I, that photo, oh my gosh.  
With your Panthers and your Antifa member shirt.

[@2:53](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=173.88) \- Amy Maestas  
Um, makes them, makes your cats look proportion, disproportionately.

[@3:00](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=180.64) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
They're actually that big in real life, believe it or That is a photo show we did at Walmart. That is a real shot.  
No, I know. They're massive. I was going to resize them or just make myself bigger, and I thought it was funnier that way.

[@3:13](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=193.3) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, the sort of he's pulling, just I'll get this off my chest and move on, is basically he personally does not believe that a university should be involved at all in public media.  
And so he's personally taken it upon himself to fight this, but he is Montclair's representative on the consortium. We are the reason why he is the board chair.  
So, and I found out yesterday, I keep finding out about him going behind my back and having meetings, and I found out yesterday that he, on Friday last week, had a meeting with, like, one of the top current senators looking into what to do with public media, who we've been trying to also, like, talk to, and I told Chris that.  
He knew that he knew me, and with his, with the lobbyists, and, like, a Bunch of other people and didn't tell me.  
And then I was like, how could you do that and not tell me? He's like, well, Stefanie, I'm not representing the consortium.  
I'm representing myself. And I caught him on that lie. was like, you were there with the consortium's lobbyist. Don't try to tell me you're not representing the consortium and you're our representative on the consortium.  
So I threatened to pull him off the board. And that was that. So, because we can, we just pull him off the board, but it wouldn't look good because then they're going to use that and make a headline that says like, Montclair State wants to help run public media, but they're, they get, you know, but they're censoring free thought.  
They removed their board member because he wouldn't comply, you know? And like, he's not listening to me. I'm trying to set this up so that we have the public media television station programmed here, but we contract externally with journalists and a journalism organization to prevent the effort.

Typical issues that people are worried about, about a university controlling journalism. But anyhow, so that's what I'm doing all day, guys.  
So we're here to talk about the summit.

[@5:11](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=311.58) \- Amy Maestas  
FYI, not that this is topic, I'll put it in Slack, but my trip back there is off.

[@5:28](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=328.3) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)

It's crazy.

I was on United, but my flight back there was Delta, which I just got an e-credit for it, because it, um, yeah.  
Anyway. Okay. And hopefully we'll get the strategy work rescheduled soonish and I'll just come back for that.

[@6:10](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=370.26) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, I'm going to try to. So I actually have been talking to Jessica Clark about coming here and doing our strategy stuff in January.  
I'm still so shocked that she died. Like, so shocked. Do you guys work with her?

[@6:26](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=386.26) \- Delaney Butler  
Did you know her? Yeah. I was so, um, yeah. Cause it sounds like it was very sudden and, and she was young.  
I don't, yeah.

[@6:34](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=394.5) \- Stefanie Murray  
I really like, yeah.

[@6:36](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=396.32) \- Delaney Butler  
And of course everyone talking about her, like I, I didn't know her super well. Liza knew her like better.  
That was how I knew her, but, um, yeah, no, everything. And everything people are saying about her, it's like very, um, I guess it's like clearly very intense for people, you know?  
Yeah.

[@6:52](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=412.62) \- Stefanie Murray  
And she had all these, I mean, you know, she was kind of like everywhere, like totally, totally. Yeah. She did our strategic planning for us.  
Um, Five years ago, six, well, six, you know, because, and she was, I mean, we loved working with Jessica, and then she was, and I saw her in New Orleans, and her and Tom Glaser were doing the visioning, so, yeah, I just emailed her like two weeks earlier, and I had a call scheduled with her on October 29th to plan out what she could do for us and her timing, and they emailed me that morning and said they had to cancel because of her, it turned out she had passed away the day before.  
Yeah, like, yeah, so, I don't know, so I actually have not given that thought about who, Liza has another person that she had been in touch with, recommended, so I, that's actually, I should put that a little higher up on my list, Amy, think, for a good reminder to look at.

[@7:45](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=465.64) \- Delaney Butler  
Was it, was it Sarah Lee?

[@7:47](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=467.8) \- Stefanie Murray  
It was, yes.

[@7:49](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=469.02) \- Delaney Butler  
Okay, yeah, I think she would be good, yeah, because, because Liza and I, yeah, just so you know, Liza did suggest Jennifer Preston, and I was like, no.  
I was like, I'm pulling, no. And then I was like, there's too much. And then she was like, what about Jessica Clark or Sarah Lee?

[@8:03](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=483.921) \- Stefanie Murray  
And I said, I think they would both be great.

[@8:06](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=486.461) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah.

[@8:07](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=487.241) \- Stefanie Murray  
I don't know Sarah Lee, but.

[@8:09](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=489.461) \- Delaney Butler  
She's cool. And she like, she's actually going back to do her doctorate in kind of like nonprofit management. And so she's like really, really thinking about this kind of stuff.  
And she's very, has a calming presence, I think. Yeah. You know, like she's very, like.

[@8:28](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=508.561) \- Amy Maestas  
She's, she's responsible for getting the Southwest Michigan Collaborative going.

[@8:33](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=513.661) \- Stefanie Murray  
Oh, cool.

[@8:34](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=514.561) \- Amy Maestas  
Okay. She was with the Southwest. Yeah. She's in Kalamazoo. Yeah.

[@8:40](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=520.561) \- Delaney Butler  
She worked for the Southwest Community Foundation and, and then.

[@8:45](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=525.841) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah. They laid her off. And then she was a chronicle of philanthropy. I don't know where she, I can't remember where she's now.

[@8:53](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=533.741) \- Stefanie Murray  
I have a bias for Michigan people.

[@8:55](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=535.621) \- Delaney Butler  
So yeah. Yeah. Well, she's not a. She's not from Michigan originally, but she's embraced.

[@9:03](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=543.02) \- Stefanie Murray  
All right, that's fine. She's embraced the mitten.

[@9:05](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=545.74) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah. But she's at Fetzer now.

[@9:09](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=549.06) \- Stefanie Murray  
Cool. Okay. Okay, good. I will come back to that. Okay, so we, I think we updated everyone in Slack last week, but INN doesn't know where the it's going to have its conference in.  
It's basically the bottom line.

[@9:26](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=566.38) \- Amy Maestas  
So North Carolina's out?

[@9:28](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=568.48) \- Stefanie Murray  
They say North Carolina, yeah, so basically, they, Queens, so she said that Queens told them that they weren't available, but Denise told me that when she contacted Queens, they just, they will only let you schedule an event between a certain, like six to 12 months.  
So when INN inquired, it wasn't in their six to 12 month window. So, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  
So Denise inquired last week, and I don't know if they got back to her. And then they said that they looked at all the other colleges and universities in Charlotte, and no one had openings.  
They had one response from Chapel Hill. It was Chapel Hill? And it was really expensive, like wildly expensive. And it was only in, like, that was the one in July, like mid-July.  
And that's just not going to be the best timing. So I'm hoping still Denise may be, I mean, if Queens comes through, that could solve some issues.  
So then their event planner, good Lord, who we can't stand working with, Shamika, just randomly put out a post on LinkedIn that was like, hey.  
And so now they're getting responses from all over the country. And the cheapest one that they got so far is.  
From Tucson.

[@11:02](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=662.561) \- Delaney Butler  
That could actually.

[@11:04](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=664.001) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
What do you guys think about that? the summer? Absolutely not. Hard glass, red state, hot state in the summer.  
that. I'm voting no.

[@11:12](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=672.321) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay, so Delaney.

[@11:13](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=673.601) \- Delaney Butler  
Go ahead. Well, Amy and I are talking to some folks in Tucson and, you know, just for, you know, upstart, upstart, collaborative, passionate people purposes.  
Yeah. We're talking to the people at the university tomorrow. You can see if, like, if they're cool.

[@11:31](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=691.941) \- Stefanie Murray  
Go ahead. What's university?

[@11:35](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=695.501) \- Delaney Butler  
ASU or? No, it's.

[@11:37](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=697.321) \- Stefanie Murray  
No, it's.

[@11:39](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=699.521) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah, I was going to say it's not.

[@11:40](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=700.941) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
It's not ASU. Can I just, can I just say one thing that's been on my mind?

[@11:45](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=705.761) \- Stefanie Murray  
sorry. Go ahead. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Amy, what do you think about?

[@11:48](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=708.661) \- Amy Maestas  
Oh, what are they still talking about that timing of June, early June? Yes.

[@11:53](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=713.521) \- Delaney Butler  
Okay. You know what is interesting, though? Sorry, Joe, really quick. The Community Foundation in Tucson did tell us. events that they basically like can't do events in the summer.

[@12:03](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=723.501) \- Amy Maestas  
Remember, Amy, Jenny told us that? I don't remember that, but it's a dry heat, Joe.

[@12:10](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=730.161) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah, like Jenny was saying they do all of their events in the fall. You'll be inside, Joe. Yeah, I was just, I just, I was, it just stood out to me because Jenny Flynn mentioned it like specifically.  
She was like, she was like, oh, she's like, we're heading into like busy season because it's like tolerable right now.

[@12:27](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=747.461) \- Amy Maestas  
I don't remember that, but got a good memory. Stood out to me. Why they could do it so cheaply if Tucson came calling.

[@12:34](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=754.961) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry, Joe.

[@12:38](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=758.321) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I just wanted, this has just been sort of eating at me with the INN thing. I personally, I don't think we should work with INN for this, but also because this is the 10th year anniversary of the summit and it just feels so much of a peter out to tie it to this milquetoast conference that INN does and to have it.

[@12:56](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=776.221) \- Stefanie Murray  
Not a milquetoast conference and a lot of people go to it.

[@12:59](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=779.381) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
A lot of people go. But we don't need that. We don't. That's fine. And that's cool. They have. I'm not shitting on them necessarily, but it's.

[@13:06](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=786.621) \- Stefanie Murray  
We're trying to keep our numbers.

[@13:07](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=787.721) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
To tag along with them. I get that. To tag along with them on that and attach it to another conference and have it only one day.  
Not saying we don't we need to have two days and then to have it in a red state where the average temperature is 102 degrees in June.  
I don't think we're going to see a lot of people and I don't think it does justice to all the work that we've done on this for the last 10 years.  
To have the 10th anniversary just be like a little in the heat.

[@13:30](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=810.761) \- Stefanie Murray  
it's not going to be.

[@13:32](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=812.661) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
It was so frustrating and so stressful working with them to do DC. I just don't think it's worth it.

[@13:39](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=819.541) \- Stefanie Murray  
It wasn't as bad.

[@13:41](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=821.361) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
was.

[@13:41](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=821.861) \- Stefanie Murray  
And we it was.

[@13:42](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=822.481) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
You're misremembering. And we literally started the first meeting. ended that meeting and we went, now I remember why we don't like working with them on conferences.

[@13:49](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=829.861) \- Stefanie Murray  
It's the beginning part, this part, because Shemeika is horrible. She's horrible. I totally agree with that. She's a terrible event planner.

[@13:57](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=837.241) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, we we were we were talking about Pittsburgh or North Carolina. At the end of last summit, and now we're working with the horrible event planner at the beginning, for them the beginning, and we're going and we're thinking about Tucson in June all of a sudden, because INN clearly doesn't know how to do their research on venue spaces and is posting on LinkedIn about it.  
It just seems like it's a perfect off-ramp time before we get too much of a sunk cost, and we chase them around the country while they fumble their way through venues.

[@14:26](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=866.042) \- Stefanie Murray  
But then we're back to square one with, is anyone going to show up to our conference when there are 5 million conferences constantly happening and people are burned out on conferences?

[@14:38](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=878.122) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
But we've talked about that, and then we should adjust what we're doing to make it fit the demand of the time and distinguish ourselves.

[@14:45](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=885.322) \- Stefanie Murray  
That's exactly what we're doing by connecting it to another conference that a lot of our people already go to.

[@14:50](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=890.482) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I'm going to support whatever decision we end up making. If you're telling me it's locked in and there's no off-ramp, then I'm on board.  
I'll keep doing it. But unless I get the confirmation that it's off-ramp, I'm going to going to continue pushing to avoid this before we officially lock it in and explore other options, maybe independent of INN.

[@15:08](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=908.262) \- Stefanie Murray  
Nothing is locked in.

[@15:09](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=909.802) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay, then I'll continue to advocate respectfully and forcefully for a change, of course, before it's too late.

[@15:17](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=917.542) \- Stefanie Murray  
I registered my dissent, and we can move on. If you have anything that you want to say about that, I just, I really don't want to risk having no one show up at our conference and having a registration of like 80 people.  
70, 80 people.

[@15:32](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=932.522) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I'll start collecting and taking different photos of positive COVID tests so that if it gets to three weeks or whatever before the summit, we can all just say we all got COVID and the summit's canceled or on our virtual or something.  
No, no, no, no.

[@15:45](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=945.762) \- Stefanie Murray  
If it's too embarrassing, we only have 80 people. I'm not happy that, you know, that INN either has had so much trouble finding a conference space in North Carolina.  
And I detest working with Shamika because she's a nice woman.

[@16:00](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=960.002) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
But she's a terrible event planner, and she's kind of like, even if, oh Jesus, even if she's not terrible, she just has such a fundamentally different conference and event organizing style that it stresses me out, stresses Denise out, it stresses you out.  
It's not worth it.

[@16:16](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=976.802) \- Amy Maestas  
Is there an idea of like, if we didn't pair, I totally hear you, Stefanie, about INN attaching, because we capture people who are going to go to INN, and they're often so much of this overlap, you know, same people.  
Um, and, um, but I wonder if we don't attach them, if they're, if we do a small, a space, um, and cap the number of attendees, and then, and then hype it up as.

[@16:49](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1009.72) \- Stefanie Murray  
Or some fake, yeah.

[@16:51](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1011.12) \- Amy Maestas  
Pipe it up and say, hey, you should register once we hit X number of people, you're, you know, we're not.  
We're to accept more, we're going to, you know, and hype it up around that way and do like a smaller, because I'm thinking of like that conference here, the business of local that they held here in Salt Lake.  
Yeah. I think that probably, David Grant was telling me they had around, I can't remember if it was between 180 and 200\.

[@17:22](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1042.1) \- Stefanie Murray  
And it was, yeah, they paid for a lot of people to go to.

[@17:25](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1045.32) \- Amy Maestas  
Oh, that's right. That's true.

[@17:27](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1047.3) \- Stefanie Murray  
Press Forward picked up the tab for, I think, like 50 of them, entire tab.

[@17:31](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1051.9) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah, Press Forward people, right. But I'm saying this, the space. get it, yeah. The space of where they were, like, fits a 180, 100 people kind of conference.  
And if we say, this year, you know, don't miss out.

[@17:49](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1069.08) \- Stefanie Murray  
I don't know. I don't know if that would work.

[@17:50](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1070.6) \- Amy Maestas  
mean, if that backtracked somewhere.

[@17:52](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1072.96) \- Delaney Butler  
Like a little, a little exclusivity, right?

[@17:55](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1075.92) \- Amy Maestas  
Like a little, thank you.

[@17:58](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1078.86) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We could do that. That is an option to do something that feels exclusive. So the other options that we looked into were Queens, which I just asked Denise if she can call up there because they have an events phone number.  
Just ask because they haven't gotten back to her yet. Well, Queens at North Carolina?

[@18:30](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1110.26) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah. I mean, Chris Rudisill is now at Queens because the collaborative is based at Queens now. Yeah.

[@18:39](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1119.48) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah, he like works out. He like works on campus a couple days a week.

[@18:43](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1123.14) \- Stefanie Murray  
So if, because we just need an answer if they have any open availability. Denise submitted their full event form.

Never mind that. If we could get INN to be in Queens, too, that would be ideal.

Yeah, well, I mean, Shamika is like one of those hotel event planners. Like she, and we are, you know, bootstrap, biased toward action, little group people.  
Then we also look at Pittsburgh, and Point Park does not have enough room for us, not even us. And then Decayne, is that how you say it?

Okay. I'm going to ask him if he can connect us up. Okay. Okay. Let me call Chris after this meeting, see where we're at.  
All right, so more thoughts about big topics we need to cover and speakers we need to have. I'm going give him that more thought since last week.

Well, it's so irritating.

What is happening? So Marty had to, so actually, Denise, I mean, Amy and Delaney, you'll be interested to know this.  
So the carousel just sort of finally broke. And I spent an hour and a half yesterday combing through the code of the plugins that we use.  
And I found a typo in the word initialize or initiate. And it was missing an I, a second. But I couldn't find where to edit that code.  
so I went to Marty. A literal type of, I think one of the plugin developers, one of the plugins we had installed, one of the plugins pushed a new update and misspelled the word initiate as initiate.  
And it took me, again, it took me forever to find it. When I finally did, then I had to find out where I could edit it and I couldn't find it.  
So I talked to Marty, who is our WordPress developer. He spent hours last night trying to find it. He couldn't fix it either.  
So he rebuilt the carousel to be no longer a carousel that feeds all the posts. And I talked to this morning.  
I said, whoa, you don't put too much in that because we hate the carousel. We're trying to get rid of it because there's also this new theme update that everybody has to go through at the university.  
So instead, I told him, like, let's use this as an opportunity to get rid of the carousel and replace it with the site that we, the three of us have been, you know, wanting to change it.  
But for now, he's going to finish the quick rebuild. That he's doing so that it is functional and it'll just, I'll just have to manually input the five things that are at the top.  
The posts page will still remain collaborativejournalism.network.posts, but when we get the new theme, when he gets this stable and then we get the new theme, we'll be able to do that full redesign that we've been talking about.

[@25:22](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1522.04) \- Stefanie Murray  
Wow. But is it going to be up, back up?

[@25:25](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1525.34) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I don't know. Right now, it's still giving me a 4.0, I mean, a 5.22 error connection timed out. So he must still be in there because it's the host side.  
It's not Cloudflare or the browser.

[@25:37](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1537.02) \- Stefanie Murray  
As long as he's in there and he knows that.

[@25:39](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1539.18) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. Yeah. He's rebuilding that or, you know, reconstructing a version of that from scratch.

[@25:44](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1544.72) \- Stefanie Murray  
God bless him. Okay. Okay. So I think that's good for today. We all do need to block out some time individually and just.

[@25:54](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1554.88) \- Amy Maestas  
I think I'm looking at the, this thing in Airtable. Mm-hmm. Um. that's that's today.

[@25:59](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1559.84) \- Stefanie Murray  
I think think

[@26:01](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1561.84) \- Amy Maestas  
And I just, I think if we can, I mean, if we do with, if we pair with INN, the summit will be one day ahead of INN.

[@26:18](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1578.18) \- Stefanie Murray  
Is that right? Is that how we're looking at it? Yes.

[@26:22](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1582.0) \- Amy Maestas  
Okay. As opposed to like two and a half days on our own.

[@26:25](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1585.78) \- Stefanie Murray  
That's right.

[@26:26](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1586.26) \- Amy Maestas  
But if we did that paired with INN and we did that one day before INN, I, my suggestion, just based on what we've been talking to people and where people's heads are at, great job of like how to work together, how to collaborate, how to do these sorts of things is to make it a theme of revenue and sustainability and hit those topics hard.  
And like blue engine coaching on how to build revenue. Um, uh, I was talking to a friend who. I was coaching for Blue Engine.  
She works for George's Media, but to do a webinar for collaboratives about small donor dollars, how to get, you know, donor donations from small dollar, you know, people calls to action.  
So if we do this one day thing, my suggestion is that we really focus on revenue and sustainability. Yeah.  
Collaboratives and less about the how we collaborated, how we did this, how here's how you can find partners kind of a thing.  
Yeah. are a lot easier. People are really like have that sustainability revenue, those revenue topics on.

[@27:45](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1665.2) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah.

[@27:45](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1665.8) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah. And already a lot of these topics in here are.

[@27:49](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1669.92) \- Stefanie Murray  
They are from a topic. Yeah. The only pause I have on that is two pauses. One is that. I.  
I actually think we should try to hit, I think that's a good potential focus, but I also think that thinking about aligning with our Knight Grant, and also thinking about what's been previously popular at CJS's, I also think that we do need to have like an impact discussion.

[@28:20](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1700.22) \- Amy Maestas  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, for sure, bring Carrie.

[@28:22](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1702.82) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, but then also, also just the ideas for new collaboratives, I don't want to let that go so quickly because if we focus solely on like revenue and sustainability for collaboratives, it just totally narrows the group of people who will want to show up.  
It's going to narrow it all the way down to just people who are already in collaboratives who are interested in sustainability, because a lot of people do come to CJS because they just want to hear new ideas about interesting things that people are trying.  
Um, so that's my only concern about that, but we could have session, like, we could have a whole, like.  
Several sessions around revenue sustainability or do like a Tuesday morning thing that is hyper-focused too.

[@29:07](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1747.12) \- Amy Maestas  
Or we'd break it into tracks, like take our night grant for the hub. And basically it's three things, new collaboratives, impact, and revenue, basically.  
So if we broke it into have a three-track conference and focus on those, like bring, you know, have people like bring Carrie Porter to do and have fewer topics, but more concentrated tracks for those things that you just talked about.  
So we still have the new ideas, the new, here's what, here's what new collaboratives are doing.

[@29:51](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1791.0) \- Stefanie Murray  
I don't know if we have enough people to do tracks.

[@29:55](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1795.18) \- Amy Maestas  
We don't, is that what you said?

[@29:56](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1796.42) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, I don't know if we have enough people, that's the only thing. It's going to end up like... 10 to 30 max people.  
Let's keep thinking about that.

[@30:04](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1804.3) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Let's keep thinking about it. where are we getting that number that we only are going to have 30 people show up at the conference?

[@30:09](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1809.1) \- Stefanie Murray  
I'm just thinking whenever we, well, no, no, no, not.

[@30:12](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1812.04) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, per track, you're saying?

[@30:13](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1813.66) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. When we've done that in the past and we split, because our conference is so small, we tend to end up with rooms that only have like 10 to 15 to like.

[@30:22](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1822.92) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Also, I also just want to clarify, is our conference really that small? Was just the last one was a little small?  
Because the one before that in D.C.

[@30:31](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1831.98) \- Stefanie Murray  
was fine. The one in Chicago was fine.

Registration was 180, but I think Denise and I counted, we usually had like 80 to 110\. Well, Denise wasn't there, but I counted.  
It was between 80 and 110 that were ever like. Physically all together in the room.

[@31:03](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1863.2) \- Amy Maestas  
Gotcha.

[@31:04](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1864.24) \- Stefanie Murray  
Because a bunch of those people were speakers who came in and left.

[@31:08](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1868.22) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah, gotcha.

[@31:10](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1870.92) \- Stefanie Murray  
Okay. And Joe, we're also just proactive.

[@31:13](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1873.58) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
We had 252 people register for Detroit.

[@31:16](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1876.5) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. So we're also proactively, yeah, but with Detroit, that number was inflated, remember, on Eventbrite? Because a bunch of people for the Detroit party, we registered Eventbrite and they didn't come to the conference.  
We had problems with Eventbrite that year. We're proactively also reacting ahead of time to the trend that we see that I hear that people are over-conferenced.  
Yeah.

[@31:40](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1900.66) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
2023 was 253\.

[@31:43](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1903.12) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, we had always been at 250 until this year.

[@31:47](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1907.44) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. So it was basically just last, it was just this year. I just don't want us to get in a mindset that we're only going to pull like 100 people because we went to, in the middle of nowhere, in Colorado with a 45-minute drive from the airport.

[@31:59](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1919.86) \- Stefanie Murray  
And that's... 35-minute drive to downtown, and people didn't show up. That's not why people didn't come.

[@32:06](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1926.84) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
273 in 2022, it's consistently above 250, except for last year. I just want to point out that that's an outlier.

[@32:14](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1934.4) \- Stefanie Murray  
It's not the norm. That's totally true, and part of the reason is because this year, people's budgets have been massively cut.

[@32:24](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1944.96) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yes, no, I agree, I agree. I'm just saying we've got to make sure it's not a trend yet, is what I'm saying.

[@32:29](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1949.16) \- Stefanie Murray  
It's not technically a trend, that's all. I got you. Also, Press Forward is creating conferences everywhere, and Lenfest suddenly has this huge- conference that people are going to.  
Speaking of, was telling you, I'm really glad my friend Emily is part of all this now, because she was telling me about some of the insane costs that they're spending on at Press Forward, and it is crazy, and so she hates wasteful spending.  
you. you. you. you. And she was telling me about how all the conferences they send people to and the wacky amount of money they've been spending on travel.

[@33:06](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1986.06) \- Amy Maestas  
It's crazy. Press forward?

[@33:08](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1988.16) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. Their operating budget was supposed to be $2 million. They're spending $4 million. So run, press forward.

[@33:19](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1999.08) \- Amy Maestas  
Oh.

[@33:19](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=1999.96) \- Stefanie Murray  
A million dollars in consultants only.

[@33:23](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2003.62) \- Amy Maestas  
Whew.

[@33:24](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2004.34) \- Stefanie Murray  
Right?

[@33:25](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2005.96) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah.

[@33:27](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2007.12) \- Stefanie Murray  
Anyhow. Now that's not here nor there, but I'm just.

[@33:29](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2009.68) \- Delaney Butler  
No. I was going to say, no comment.

[@33:32](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2012.16) \- Stefanie Murray  
I was saying, like, just thinking about all the things I could do with $4 million.

[@33:36](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2016.54) \- Delaney Butler  
Right?

[@33:38](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2018.18) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, yeah.

[@33:38](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2018.88) \- Delaney Butler  
Nothing else to say about that. Sorry.

[@33:40](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2020.62) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
That was okay.

[@33:42](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2022.44) \- Delaney Butler  
Nothing else. Yeah.

[@33:44](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2024.0) \- Stefanie Murray  
So, um, anyhow, we're just trying to, I am operating under assumption, Joe, that this is the start of a trend, I guess.

[@33:54](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2034.74) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
That's, I mean, that's a fair thing to be prepared for. I'm not, I'm not saying you're, you're, you're a misplaced.  
Nothing. Thank I just want to make sure we also don't plan and mindset ourselves into manifesting into lower attendance because we go in thinking that nobody likes us and nobody wants to come to our show.

[@34:11](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2051.24) \- Stefanie Murray  
But I do think it's a fair point that if we, like, we really worked hard in those other years on having some really good speakers that people were excited and our programming was kind of flat in Denver.

[@34:28](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2068.86) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
I would agree. There were some highlights, but that was one of the big feedback points that we saw, that it was sort of, it wasn't, it maybe not fully flat even, but just not, like, coherent in a way that was strong in previous sessions.

[@34:43](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2083.04) \- Stefanie Murray  
because, I mean, to be honest, I felt like I kind of mailed it in a little bit because I relied too heavily on pitches last year to build the schedule.

[@34:50](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2090.56) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, we need your iron fist of scheduling.

[@34:53](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2093.24) \- Stefanie Murray  
Well, you know what I mean. Not, I know, right?

[@34:56](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2096.22) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
No, mean, I've been that genuinely, like, you're able to, I don't think we did. The trends, the state of collaborative journalism last year either, so I don't think you were forced to give that bird's eye view of what's going on in the field.

[@35:08](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2108.45) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah, like I, we, we were much more heavy-handed in CJS past about really trying to control the schedule.

[@35:18](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2118.34) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Curate. Curate, yeah.

[@35:21](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2121.08) \- Stefanie Murray  
Curate. And I just, I didn't do that as much last year. Because we got so many pitches last year.  
We got more pitches last year than we'd ever had before. So I was, you know, we were kind of operating under, you know, we live and learn, but operating also under like, oh, well, if people are pitching these, they want to hear them.  
And it wasn't, it's a program, was a little flat. But I also think that Denver had something to do with it.

[@35:47](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2147.81) \- Amy Maestas  
I thought it was going to be a great choice. Yeah. I wonder why.

[@35:52](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2152.25) \- Stefanie Murray  
mean. I think it's because the conference pulls heavy on the East Coast.

[@35:55](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2155.6) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah, what I did hear from like West Coast people. Was that they were really excited that it was in Denver because I think because everybody has to go to the East Coast all the time for conference.  
Yeah. Yeah. So like so like a lot of people who I think don't go, you know, because because we have we have those people who come to this like every single year.  
It's like the one that they really do. But there were I remember talking to people last year who were on the West Coast who were like, oh, I was excited that I could like squeeze this.

[@36:23](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2183.31) \- Stefanie Murray  
And so it was totally right.

[@36:25](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2185.41) \- Delaney Butler  
definitely I mean, it's always on people's mind, right? Like where stuff is.

[@36:29](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2189.49) \- Stefanie Murray  
That's why Angela was just asking me where ours is. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[@36:34](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2194.79) \- Amy Maestas  
I mean, as somebody who lives in the West, I, you know, oh, yeah, very much the vast majority are East.  
Yeah. And and you don't forget it and don't forget it. That's right. And I mean, which probably impacts people's, you know, budgets as people there's, you know, it's not, you know, going East is not.  
But is, you know, not, not. Cheap, and so you probably get a lot of non-Western half of the states going to these things because of things are always in the East.  
If you want to go to two or three conferences in the summer or in a year and all three are in the East, it's just like, well, the expense of that, so we have to drop.

[@37:20](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2240.97) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, and it's more expensive coming the other way.

[@37:24](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2244.55) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah.

[@37:25](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2245.87) \- Delaney Butler  
Or like, I don't know if maybe like my perception of that is like skewed by like being near, like being in your hub, but like I always like, I feel like, Amy, I feel like if you are going to come out here, I feel like it's more expensive than like if I have to go to Denver for.

[@37:43](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2263.23) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah.

[@37:44](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2264.13) \- Delaney Butler  
Do you know what mean?

[@37:45](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2265.19) \- Stefanie Murray  
Yeah. So did, was INN looking at anywhere? East? I mean, West?

[@37:54](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2274.59) \- Amy Maestas  
Beyond Pittsburgh? As West as they've gotten?

[@37:58](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2278.65) \- Delaney Butler  
Well, Chicago.

[@37:59](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2279.63) \- Stefanie Murray  
that's great. Yeah, no, they were looking at Interlands. They had done their conference in San Diego most recently, and then they, or no, where was I in?  
Minneapolis, and then before that was in San Diego, but they were looking at D.C., Memphis, Charlotte, possibly Pittsburgh, and so going back to the West Coast is okay for them because they were in Minneapolis last year, but they had wanted to come to the East Coast because they kind of go like this.

[@38:29](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2309.99) \- Amy Maestas  
across the country is their plan.

[@38:33](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2313.93) \- Stefanie Murray  
Right. I have to run to the bathroom. I'm going to email Chris and call him and talk to him and see what we can find out about Queens, and then.

[@38:43](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2323.57) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Oh, Chris.

[@38:44](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2324.71) \- Stefanie Murray  
was like, what? And then we'll also see what the cane says about Pittsburgh, and then I'll try to check in with Courtney later today, too.  
And then we all need to just give some thought to great speakers.

[@38:57](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2337.33) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Roger that.

[@39:01](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2341.33) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah, well, you know, we could have possibly the project managers from the Sustainability Accelerator come and talk.

[@39:12](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2352.67) \- Delaney Butler  
I think people would like that. And because I just feel like, yeah, like, this has always been true, but I guess maybe it's more pronounced now for various reasons.  
Like, I just feel like people, like, yes, there's the focus on sustainability, obviously, but like, kind of like, I just feel more and more that like what so many people want is to be in a room with like all of those superstar project managers, just, and just, you know, get all of this information from them.  
So I like the idea of having like the four of them kind of like available for learning.

[@40:00](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2400.01) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, and I think one last note on the tracks, the tracks thing, I think it's a good idea, but we should do what you guys said and focus on not like the particular type of, or particular topic of session, but the experience or entry level of the attendees.  
Like even, and Stephanie had said earlier, you know, there's a lot of people just want to come and learn about what's happening and see what collaboration is, and then we don't want to just cater to people who are already established and looking to move to, you know, making money.  
But I think that just plays perfectly into what you at all, you both had suggested from last year, which is do the tracks maybe, but focus on the experience, the collaborative experience of the cohort, not the like money and tools and, you know, management tracks kind of a thing.  
But beginner, intermediate, veteran, or whatever.

[@40:52](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2452.37) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah. I do find too, though, like even people who are just starting out, right, like people who are just starting out who I talk to are...  
We're asking about sustainability a lot sooner.

[@41:02](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2462.85) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah. Yeah. That's what I mean.

[@41:04](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2464.31) \- Delaney Butler  
Yeah.

[@41:04](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2464.75) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Whether they're the beginner or the expert, they may be asking about money, but we can tailor those tracks to people's specific experience levels so that we can make sure that those who have a wider, more eclectic interest or curiosity are still served.

[@41:25](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2485.53) \- Amy Maestas  
Hmm.

[@41:32](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2492.03) \- Delaney Butler  
I'm not good at knowing who is the big draw, right? Like, I think that's what Stephanie's getting at, right?  
Like, who are a couple of people who are, like, a big draw?

[@41:43](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2503.73) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Yeah, that's tough for me, too. I mean, I also have different ideas of what would draw me versus what would draw people, I guess.  
And not to be like, oh, I have particular tastes, but, like, I just am not tapped in in that way.

[@41:58](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2518.49) \- Delaney Butler  
That's all. Mm-hmm.

[@42:16](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2536.45) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
All right. Do you guys, you said you're good for the collaborative journalism managers meeting today, but is there anything I can do to help or assist with?  
If not, that's fine, but just checking one more time.

[@42:27](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2547.03) \- Delaney Butler  
There she is. Yeah, yeah. So Joe, where I'm at right now with that is I'm not expecting a huge group today.  
And so I did some outreach to folks ahead of time because I knew this was going to happen. Although I did get a couple emails this morning from people who want to be there.  
But yeah, so what I want to talk to the people who do show up today about is like how they want to share this kind of information, because the sense that I'm getting is that like some people really want to, you know, come to calls and like problem solve together.  
Yeah. They're project managers. I think some people don't want that or need that anymore. And Amy and I have talked about that a little bit.  
So I was kind of trying to understand some different, I think there are some different segments of people who are coming to that call.

[@43:16](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2596.55) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Okay.

[@43:17](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2597.57) \- Delaney Butler  
So I know that sounds very nebulous for my plans for a 30-minute call this afternoon, but that's what's on my mind.

[@43:31](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2611.03) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Sounds good to me.

[@43:32](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2612.57) \- Stefanie Murray  
Courtney also just got back to me and said that they are waiting for proposals from three Pittsburgh hotels as well.

[@43:42](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2622.05) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
All right.

[@43:43](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2623.09) \- Stefanie Murray  
So.

[@43:43](https://fathom.video/share/1NNDPzzjWRbtty8sAJhSL4g2KtwSBX24?timestamp=2623.79) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Cool.
