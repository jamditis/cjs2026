Thank you. Hi.

[@0:39](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=39.22) \- **Denise Shannon**

Hey, Kim. How are you?

Good. How are you?

[@0:42](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=42.46) \- **Denise Shannon**

Good.

[@0:43](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=43.54) \- **Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)**

Hey, hey.

[@0:44](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=44.98) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

Hi.

[@0:48](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=48.98) \- **Denise Shannon**

Joe, Stephanie, let everyone know what you were really doing this morning.

[@0:53](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=53.68) \- **Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)**

No. Traitor. I'm deep in thought and thought leadership right now in the. At the conference, that is very good and not a bunch of wealthy people in power telling us that they love robocars.

I've actually been working on CJS stuff all day and then the ECM stuff. I got some stuff cooking.

[@1:19](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=79.1) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay. Well, the good news is I think we're in Pennsylvania. It's just a matter of what part of Pennsylvania.

Yeah. I'm assuming that Courtney can't join.

[@1:31](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=91.74) \- **Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)**

Yeah, she's joining.

[@1:33](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=93.32) \- **Denise Shannon**

Because she's at the same conference as you.

[@1:37](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=97.86) \- **Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)**

Stephanie looks like she's trying to join a Lisa meeting.

[@1:41](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=101.5) \- **Denise Shannon**

Yeah. She said that she wouldn't be able to. I just said to her, well, I'll jump on and see if Kem and Shemeika are going to be on.

[@1:55](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=115.1) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

I don't. I think Shemeika might be out sick today.

[@1:59](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=119.16) \- **Denise Shannon**

Oh, okay.

[@2:00](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=120.98) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

Yeah. The bug going around, but yes.

[@2:07](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=127.74) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay. Well, I guess the only thing that things that we have to report are that we, yeah, two days ago, we talked to Temple about doing it in Philly.

Okay. are not sure if that could, that week could work for you all. They, it's actually in May, the week of May 11th.

[@2:38](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=158.72) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

Okay.

[@2:39](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=159.9) \- **Denise Shannon**

So 11th, 12th, and 13th could potentially be your days, and we would end the week 14th and 15th.

[@2:53](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=173.52) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

Okay.

[@2:54](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=174.8) \- **Denise Shannon**

So if you want to look at that idea, and then we had great call. We're with Pittsburgh, and it looks like Duquesne can accommodate us if you all are downtown, and we're, you know, five miles away at Duquesne, so I just have to put in the event request form.

just sent it on to me this morning, so that's kind of all that we've got going on. We're just hoping that we can nail it down this week.

[@3:30](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=210.0) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

For Duquesne, what days are those?

[@3:33](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=213.74) \- **Denise Shannon**

That's the week, that's the week that you all, the week of the 15th, and correct me if I'm wrong, I thought I read somewhere that Courtney wants to be the 16th, 17th, and 18th.

[@3:52](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=232.56) \- **courtbeth**

So they became, like, the go-to. How did you do that? How did you keep your people safe? You know, they had all these tools where never, you know.

Tag team each other. If you're two people from an outlet, one goes into the scrum, and then the other is out, and you alternate.

Hello?

[@4:10](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=250.56) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

Hi.

[@4:12](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=252.8) \- **courtbeth**

Sorry, guys. How's everybody?

[@4:18](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=258.46) \- **Denise Shannon**

Good, you jumped in at the perfect time.

[@4:21](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=261.52) \- **courtbeth**

Good, good.

[@4:22](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=262.96) \- **Denise Shannon**

I was just saying in my head, which I don't know if it's in my head or if I actually saw, written down somewhere, that for the Pittsburgh week, you wanted Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

[@4:35](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=275.84) \- **courtbeth**

Is that right? Yeah, we would kind of keep the same pattern. Where we might overlap with you all on some workshops on Monday.

But the conference itself would be, oh, no, no, it would be the same thing where our pre-day would be Tuesday, overlapping with some of your sessions.

[@4:57](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=297.62) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay.

[@4:58](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=298.44) \- **courtbeth**

then Wednesday, Thursday. Thursday would be the formal conference.

[@5:02](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=302.66) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay, got it. So that could, yeah, that could work perfectly. Duquesne was very, they were very accommodating.

[@5:12](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=312.64) \- **courtbeth**

They have the space and everything?

[@5:16](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=316.7) \- **Denise Shannon**

Their professors believe they have the space. I have to put in an event request form with the person who actually manages the space, but they were really, really excited about the possibility of us being there and you guys being downtown and us figuring out how to, you know, interface over the week.

[@5:42](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=342.9) \- **courtbeth**

We don't right now. aren't planning to, like, get a bunch of rooms for that Monday night, but we did it that way.

We could always add later.

[@5:51](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=351.02) \- **Denise Shannon**

It's easier to, like, add later. Oh, yeah, for sure.

[@5:55](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=355.4) \- **courtbeth**

So that means you don't need it Monday.

[@5:57](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=357.48) \- **Denise Shannon**

So, like, when we work with the hotel negotiation.

[@6:00](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=360.0) \- **courtbeth**

Should we keep Monday on the calendar or should we not?

[@6:04](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=364.62) \- **Denise Shannon**

I would say you could release them. They mentioned a couple of hotels that they have relationships with that are close to campus.

[@6:16](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=376.24) \- **courtbeth**

So I mean, like the Monday space schedule, like the hotel space.

[@6:22](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=382.0) \- **Denise Shannon**

Oh, the hotel space. Yeah, I would say, yeah, you can.

[@6:26](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=386.26) \- **courtbeth**

You don't need it.

[@6:26](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=386.9) \- **Denise Shannon**

You don't need it. We don't need it.

[@6:28](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=388.72) \- **courtbeth**

Okay.

[@6:29](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=389.68) \- **Denise Shannon**

Sorry, I thought you were talking about the room blocks.

[@6:34](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=394.68) \- **courtbeth**

That's good news. I hope this works out.

[@6:37](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=397.9) \- **Denise Shannon**

Yeah. Yeah, and I was saying to Kem right before you hopped on that we also had a really good call with Temple about doing it in Philly two days ago.

So the dates that would work there are as the week of mail-up.

[@7:01](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=421.0) \- **courtbeth**

Oh, okay. I mean, that works for us, but that is soon for you all.

[@7:06](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=426.6) \- **Denise Shannon**

Well, we, you know, we asked if we could do the day and a half at the end. If you guys can do, you know, the beginning of the week, they were excited to hear that that could be a possibility.

[@7:21](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=441.54) \- **courtbeth**

In Philly?

[@7:22](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=442.82) \- **Denise Shannon**

Mm-hmm.

[@7:23](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=443.92) \- **courtbeth**

I don't think we'd be able to do it that soon.

[@7:26](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=446.48) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay.

[@7:27](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=447.22) \- **courtbeth**

That early in the year. That probably would split our events. But LENFEST is happening in Philly in May.

[@7:38](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=458.72) \- **Denise Shannon**

Well, that's why we asked for the end of the week, because LENFEST is, starts the week of the 18th, and they run through the 21st.

But we don't really want to lead into Memorial Day weekend.

[@7:59](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=479.0) \- **courtbeth**

19th. LENFEST. LENFEST. Thank LENFEST. Thank

[@8:00](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=480.881) \- **Denise Shannon**

I just think that would really kill our attendance.

[@8:05](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=485.381) \- **courtbeth**

For context, like, we tried to overlap with LENFEST, but we didn't get far in, like, agreeing to do that, at least for 2026\.

[@8:13](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=493.761) \- **Denise Shannon**

Like, literally, like, trying to figure out, should we just combine forces because their focus area?

[@8:19](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=499.021) \- **courtbeth**

We didn't get far with that. So I don't think we would go to Philly, nor probably would we do that next year.

[@8:26](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=506.541) \- **Denise Shannon**

Or 2027, maybe there's a mega on that, but. Okay, good to know.

[@8:38](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=518.361) \- **courtbeth**

Okay, so we're supposed to be getting the contract from Pittsburgh today or tomorrow.

[@8:46](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=526.641) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay.

[@8:49](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=529.381) \- **courtbeth**

I'll just let you, we're going to move forward as long as the terms are good, so I'll just let you know if we sign that dotted line.

[@8:56](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=536.081) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay.

[@8:56](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=536.561) \- **courtbeth**

But what we'll need to do is, because as soon as it's signed, we're going to. Want to announce. So it's just a matter of whether at the time of Save the Date we talk about joint or not.

[@9:06](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=546.58) \- **Denise Shannon**

Right. Right. Got it. Yeah. I mean, we want to be able to have a decision made by the end of this week.

[@9:13](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=553.62) \- **courtbeth**

Cool.

[@9:14](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=554.38) \- **Denise Shannon**

Since we're so, you know, so behind. Did you formally back out of?

[@9:19](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=559.86) \- **courtbeth**

We haven't yet.

[@9:21](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=561.02) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay. We haven't either. No, I was waiting to talk to you to see if you had.

[@9:25](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=565.66) \- **courtbeth**

We probably won't until we, this is locked.

**ACTION ITEM: Submit Duquesne event request; email space manager re: dates/overlap \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=565.9999)**

[@9:28](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=568.1) \- **Denise Shannon**

Yeah.

[@9:29](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=569.38) \- **courtbeth**

Yep.

[@9:30](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=570.48) \- **Denise Shannon**

Yep. That's what I figured.

[@9:34](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=574.14) \- **courtbeth**

Yeah.

[@9:35](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=575.32) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay. Well, I will, um, I'll put in the request with Duquesne now.

[@9:41](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=581.44) \- **courtbeth**

Okay.

[@9:42](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=582.32) \- **Denise Shannon**

And hopefully we can make that work.

[@9:47](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=587.22) \- **courtbeth**

Sounds like a plan.

[@9:48](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=588.9) \- **Denise Shannon**

I think, you know, that's the best option.

**ACTION ITEM: Call Stephanie re: Save the Date messaging \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=589.9999)**

[@9:52](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=592.36) \- **courtbeth**

Mm-hmm.

[@9:54](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=594.08) \- **Denise Shannon**

Anything you want me to relay to Stephanie?

[@9:58](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=598.82) \- **courtbeth**

Uh, no. No. No. And just like, obviously, to save the date, we definitely want to be thoughtful of like, because if we have this locked on Friday, we probably will announce Monday or Tuesday, like as soon as we literally can.

So maybe I just might call her or something like that tomorrow or Friday to talk specifically about messaging.

[@10:25](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=625.821) \- **Denise Shannon**

Sure.

[@10:26](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=626.761) \- **courtbeth**

Yeah. But Joe is here.

[@10:28](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=628.121) \- **Denise Shannon**

Right. Joe can completely hop in on that.

[@10:30](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=630.841) \- **Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)**

Right, Joe? You'll be awake? I'm awake.

[@10:34](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=634.821) \- **courtbeth**

Yeah.

[@10:35](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=635.841) \- **Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)**

Yeah. I mean, so we have pretty much everything prepped for the launch and the announcement. Once we confirm the location, oh, screen sharing is not allowed.

Once we confirm the location, we're ready to go with this web portal here. ready go with we're ready ready ready to to go portal, ready ready

[@11:00](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=660.001) \- **courtbeth**

Can I make it so screened? Do you want to share your screen?

[@11:04](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=664.001) \- **Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)**

I don't think, none of us are the hosts, so I don't think you'll be able to do that.

[@11:06](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=666.801) \- **courtbeth**

Oh, okay.

[@11:08](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=668.321) \- **Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)**

But I don't know who's Zoom this is. It's Courtney's. Wait, are you logged It's probably mine, but I'm not logged in as my.

[@11:14](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=674.441) \- **courtbeth**

Got it. Okay.

[@11:16](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=676.101) \- **Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)**

It's fine. You should be able to go to that link. Like I said, right now it's set to Pittsburgh, but obviously that's a really quick swap.

And I got to finish updating the FAQ and the updates page. Right now, again, all of it is pointing to Pittsburgh, so if and when that changes, I'll make sure that's updated.

That should be a really relatively simple update, and then we should be good to go.

[@11:40](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=700.901) \- **courtbeth**

Okay. Sweet. All right. And that kind of reminds me, we'll probably like QRs too, minus the date and location, so that, so like Joe.

Do you think, I guess it's just a matter of like, do we think we will, I guess we just don't know if, until you know that you're at Duquesne, we probably shouldn't mention that we're at the same place, same time, type messaging.

Right, but I, but I'm going to work to make that happen so that we can announce concurrently.

Okay.

Because what's to, it's Wednesday afternoon right now. I'll put in the request and then I'll follow up an email too, since, since she wasn't on the call this morning.

Okay. All right, cool. Yeah, I'll probably see you there. Yeah, just took some time this morning to work on some stuff, so including CJS stuff.

I get something fun cooking, and if I can pull it off, it'll be really neat.

Thank you.

[@13:54](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=834.481) \- **Denise Shannon**

Same here.

[@13:55](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=835.541) \- **courtbeth**

Yep. Thanks for the hotel info. info. Thanks Yeah.

[@14:00](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=840.002) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

Oh, no problem.

[@14:02](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=842.542) \- **courtbeth**

Could you set up a call with comms in the morning so I could explain basically what's happening? Because basically I want to say, I kind of want to get everything teed up, but there are two factors that might change.

One, joint announcement with CCM, and two, date and location.

[@14:22](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=862.122) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

Okay. Do you want that top of the morning or?

[@14:28](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=868.922) \- **courtbeth**

Yeah, whenever you all are available. Okay. How comfortable would you feel just having this conversation with Hope and not me?

Like explaining to her what's happening?

[@14:40](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=880.002) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

It's just essentially that we're, like, we want to announce as soon as possible. And if that is, like, with CCM, that would be great.

But if not, like, basically cue up everything else but that.

[@14:55](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=895.102) \- **courtbeth**

Yeah. And just sort of, if you could do that, like, if you could do it without me, that'd be great.

And just asking, Like, what might she need? Because we've given her the template already.

[@15:05](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=905.582) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

Yeah, we're just changing the name and the location.

[@15:12](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=912.222) \- **courtbeth**

Ask her what she might need from us, or just, she might just need the fact that we communicate it.

[@15:17](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=917.542) \- **Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)**

But if there's anything else she needs. Okay. I mean, I can just shuttle. Yeah, I can just shuttle. Okay.

All right. All right, bye.

[@15:26](https://fathom.video/share/QaXXmjxSxZfB4xs9RxxpU9CybyHo_9XB?timestamp=926.682) \- **courtbeth**

Thank you. No problem. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
