Any news for us? Has it passed? No.

[@0:41](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=41.22) \- **Oni Advincula**

Shoot.

[@0:42](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=42.32) \- **Denise Shannon**

Jeez.

[@0:44](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=44.78) \- **Oni Advincula**

Hi, Will. Hey, how's it going?

[@0:47](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=47.42) \- **William Fischer**

Hey, Will.

[@0:48](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=48.66) \- **Oni Advincula**

How was your, all of you? Did you have a good holiday break?

[@0:55](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=55.48) \- **William Fischer**

Yeah, that was nice. Very relaxing.

[@0:59](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=59.7) \- **Oni Advincula**

No. No. No. No. Oh, what do you call this? Flu in the family? My God. Thankfully, no.

[@1:08](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=68.64) \- **William Fischer**

Yeah.

[@1:10](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=70.4) \- **Oni Advincula**

Thanks. No flu here.

[@1:12](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=72.8) \- **Denise Shannon**

Just spent too much time traveling. So it wasn't relaxing at all.

[@1:19](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=79.82) \- **Amy Maestas**

You had a long drive, right? Did you drive from South Carolina to Baltimore?

[@1:24](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=84.76) \- **Denise Shannon**

Mm-hmm. Yeah, I drove. And then we also drove to Philly. We drove to North Jersey. It just was a never-ending time in the car.

Drive. With the dogs? No, the dogs, I ended up boarding for the first time because they're fine, but then, you know, you have to deal with- I know.

[@1:49](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=109.94) \- **Oni Advincula**

That's why I asked. 24 hotels, you know, that are pet-friendly and- Right. Jack- You have to stop a lot.

Yeah. Right.

[@1:57](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=117.0) \- **Denise Shannon**

He can't drive yet, so, you know. That just just adds to the complications.

[@2:02](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=122.72) \- **Stefanie Murray**

And Oni, you took Jordan up to Maine, right?

[@2:05](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=125.06) \- **Oni Advincula**

Yes, that was the purpose because, you know, always, like Julian would always go to his family and then I have the dog.

And I said, why don't we just do the three nights with the dog and spend time with the dog?

So we drove with the dog.

[@2:24](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=144.26) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Yeah, you guys, I'm so sorry that at least 60% of us, maybe more, because I don't know about Will's break yet or Delaney's break, had really breaks.

Oh my God. feel like the center as a whole needs a break from the break because we had kidney stones, Poroni had the stomach flu, I had the flu, Cassandra had the flu, Eliza or Will or Delaney, save us here.

Denise was driving all over God's green earth. Did you have good breaks at least? Yeah, was pretty chill.

[@2:58](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=178.96) \- **William Fischer**

For you.

[@3:03](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=183.4) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Okay, so no Joe. Joe is representing us at this night's summit. And I'm waiting to hear more details about what's going on today.

After Salesforce said yesterday that AI is a human right. And then I don't know if Julie's joining us, because she doesn't have to.

[@3:26](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=206.86) \- **Amy Maestas**

Oh, I missed that.

[@3:28](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=208.74) \- **Oni Advincula**

Thank you, Amy.

[@3:29](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=209.42) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, yeah, I see. Okay, great. And then Hannah is not able to join a team meeting.

And who else are we missing? Anyone else? Because no Mariella. And that's it. So we'll get we'll get started.

I don't have a lot, but I also do have a lot. So let me just go through and start if that's okay with everyone.

The first thing is a little heavy, but I was going to say it. You know, we just talked about how everyone.

Had a rough break. And I just wanted to also point out that if you may have seen, may have not seen it, but another journalist took their own life over the break.

David Chivers, who was really close with my friend, Emily, who was the publisher of The Register, and he was running Lenfest AI Collaborative.

And then most of us know that Jessica Clark took her own life last fall, and so did John Thornton last year.

And I just wanted to bring that up because I think it's important to acknowledge that this happens, you know, in many, many industries.

But these are three, like, high-profile people in our industry, and some people who some of us in this room have been very close to.

And if you ever have these thoughts, obviously none of us are doctors, but Montclair State has support. We have mental health resources on campus that anyone can call at any time.

And, of course, you know, hopefully that you have access to your own health plans and whatnot. But... If there's ever anything that I can do or Montclair can do, if this ever, you know, affects you in any way, I just wanted to say that to everyone because, God, it's like just another gut punch.

And I don't want to see anyone in our close orbit of CCM or something like that. And then as another reminder, too, if you are not feeling well, please don't come to work.

And that goes for me, too. Everyone in the office and everyone not in the office, please don't force yourself to work if you're not feeling well.

If you don't have sick time, don't worry about it. We'll work it out with you. Don't work if you're not feeling well.

So sorry for two heavy things, but I just wanted to start with that. On the topic of also just employee stuff in general, your W-2s will be coming, hopefully, to everyone electronically.

You will get a notification when they're ready. And if one of us sees that, first we'll post it in Slack.

If you did not, put your, that you opt for the. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you. Electronic, you'll get mailed yours.

They usually come by early February. And if anyone has questions who you work with who are contractors or who were previous employees of the center, send them to Denise.

We already had Beatrice Foreman reach out asking about her W-2 this week. So if any of our contractors, folks, Denise can help you.

And Denise, June Delaney can work with that if anyone has questions who's been paid for the hub. So those are coming soon.

So those are three big things I just wanted to note to everyone. And then a couple of their funding things.

So I had a good call with Teresa Gorman right before break about democracy funds support of us and it winding down.

And they are going to still support some media, but she doesn't know how that's going to shake out. And it's very unlikely to be us.

It's very likely to be direct support. Or of organizations like Documented or El Timpano, organizations that are directly producing news and information for communities that are in harm's way in our country right now.

But she reiterated that they are super willing to help us get connected to any funder we may want to, and that they will open any door that they can for us.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Teresa Gorman funding notes (Hub, Gates, AI, Spanish translation, Media for Democracy Day) \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=434.9999)**

It's not already open. And so I told her that I would, sometime this month, I told her by mid-January, send her a few funding notes to look at.

And so I know Amy's got a deck she's working on for the Hub. Liza's got a concept note she's working on for Gates.

I have a concept note that's kind of AI-focused. I have a concept note for Oni, your work, and the Spanish translation work that needs to be worked on still.

And so I'm going to try to get this stuff prepped to send to her by the end of next week.

So just let me know if you have an idea. Media for funding Democracy Day. Well, that's one of those ones I'm going send to her too.

And then she and I are going to talk again at the end of the month to talk about like intros that she can make.

So that was, so I was good. I mean, I knew she was going to do that anyway, but it was just good to like talk very directly about it.

And then if you didn't know, Christine Schmidt, our previous program officer, was not working at Block Club Chicago. She got a job there.

So she's, yeah, because she's living in with her husband. So that's that. Also on funding, we did get the Google grant.

So Jeff Jarvis had sent a concept paper to Google that Kerry Brown, members of the humanities department here, and I had helped him with.

**SCREEN SHARING: Stefanie started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=530.682149)**

I'll do a quick screen share so you can take a peek. And it was a two-year grant. It's basically focused on these three things, this academic program that he wanted to do, because there's a new interdisciplinary.

Every school that's been launched here. That's what the hubbub was over with the humanities department in part. And so he's been working with folks over there.

This is out of my wheelhouse. Not my fever to sweat, Liza. That's right. Not your fever to sweat.

[@9:17](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=557.521) \- **Liza Gross**

Don't sweat other people's fevers.

[@9:19](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=559.241) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Not my circus, not my monkeys. I was not involved in this one. But I was involved in these two.

One is basically to support a New Jersey media creator network. So this is based in part on Carrie's research that she's doing.

So we are going to have some money to basically kind of do what Lendfest is doing. And I had mentioned this to Adriana Lacey, too, that we might do this.

We might work with her or some other organization like that on that to work with two to three potential creators in the state and partner with them and provide them support.

So then Joe, so this is actually good news for everyone on this call, because part of this great. Grant will offset some of Joe's salary and release some pressure for us in the Democracy Fund grant.

So I told Teresa that I may extend the grant again from them because I was kind of trying to slow walk the spending of it.

And she was fine with that. And so this helps because we're going to be able to fund at least half of Joe's salary probably through the new grant for Google.

And so that will free up some money in Democracy Fund. And right now, Oni and Cassandra paid from Democracy Fund.

So basically what Joe's going to do, this sounds fancier than it is, of course, but what he's going to do is he's going to work with the New Jersey Hills Media Group and possibly CalMatters and their digital democracy project to pilot some, for lack of a better word, automated documenters tools, basically, to scrape in public meetings and other public information and make it more easily available.

There are several companies that do this. Sarah Stombley told me about a new... One I didn't know about this morning called Hey Wired, but that's what this part of the grant is.

And so it's a two-year grant. We're getting year one of it. Google doesn't promise year two, but they promise year two.

It makes no sense at all. But basically, it'll be $300,000. And I have to, so that next thing Jeff and I have to do is figure out how we're going to split over each year money and how we're going to split the work.

So that's that grant. So that'll be interesting. And I'm glad we got that. And I'm especially glad it frees up some of the pressure on Democracy Fund because I needed some salary relief because, as you know, like we run out of salary money in mid-2027 right now for everyone but the hub.

So that's my focus for this year is building operational and salary money so that we can build out from there.

Any questions about that? Any of that funding stuff? stuff? Okay. The only other thing I have is retreat. So I have our strategic plan pretty much done, except for one last section.

That's the one we basically agreed to last spring, and it took me eight months to finish writing it for y'all.

But I just combined things that we've already pre-written for funders and on the site with the categories that our focus is on.

And I'll share that back with everyone. And our retreat is still planned for February 9th to do more discussion.

During that time, we're going to talk about implementing the strategic plan and things that we might stop doing because they don't align with the strategic plan, as well as things that we may start doing and tracking our impact.

And so I do have a call next week with Sarah Lee to Liza. Um, about ways that she might be able to help.

Yeah, because we thought it would be nice to bring in a facilitator, um, to help us with that discussion on the 8th.

[@13:09](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=789.561) \- **Amy Maestas**

I'll be in town for that. Um, not to divert here, but if the summit ends up being at Temple, Delaney, Liza, and I will be there for a day visit with Boardman and with Brown and stuff, so we can do recon, Denise.

Yep.

[@13:27](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=807.061) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Yeah. So let's go to that topic next. Well, the summit next, Denise, do you want to take over?

[@13:33](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=813.221) \- **Denise Shannon**

Yeah, sure. So, um, yes, it is a good segue. Um, so as most of you know, we initially thought we were bringing the summit to UNC.

Um, we've had some issues, you know. Long story short, we are, uh, no longer focused on North Carolina for a number of reasons.

[@14:01](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=841.141) \- **Liza Gross**

What an elegant way of putting it, no longer focused on North Carolina.

[@14:06](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=846.381) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Basically, they're really expensive and they refuse to amend the contract to INN's liking. And that's pretty much it. And so if INN doesn't go there, we don't really have a reason to be at UNC.

We would have a reason to be in Charlotte.

[@14:24](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=864.401) \- **Denise Shannon**

Not really at UNC.

[@14:27](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=867.501) \- **Stefanie Murray**

And so if we still stay with INN, yeah, Denise, keep going. We're looking at other options. Yep.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Dawn (Temple) re: conference center availability; then compare Philly vs Pittsburgh pricing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=881.9999)**

[@14:35](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=875.361) \- **Denise Shannon**

So we had a good call with Temple yesterday to bring it to Philadelphia. We haven't talked to Courtney about whether we would have to do that solo, correct?

Oh, yeah.

[@14:52](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=892.201) \- **Stefanie Murray**

I meant to ask. Can we ask Dawn? Could you email her or I can email her and just ask her if the conference center is available earlier that week?

Okay.

[@15:01](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=901.261) \- **Denise Shannon**

Sure.

[@15:02](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=902.261) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Because I want to be able to tell Courtney, we asked about you and their book or something. comedy.

[@15:08](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=908.001) \- **Denise Shannon**

Right, okay. You know, obviously that's in our own backyard. There's a lot of crossover in the work that happens in New Jersey and Philadelphia.

So great call there. And then earlier today, we spoke to a great team in Pittsburgh. planner at Philly before you move on to Pittsburgh.

[@15:29](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=929.561) \- **Stefanie Murray**

The event planner at Philly was so funny.

[@15:31](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=931.781) \- **Denise Shannon**

She's so Philly. Oh my God.

[@15:34](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=934.721) \- **Stefanie Murray**

So Philly.

[@15:35](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=935.921) \- **Denise Shannon**

And I said to my husband, I said, she doesn't have the Delco accent, but she has an accent that I definitely grew up hearing.

Totally.

[@15:47](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=947.241) \- **Stefanie Murray**

And she was also like, oh yeah, 's expensive, guys. Let's cut some costs. You know, like we were like, hell yeah, Dawn, speak it out loud.

Yeah, she's very funny.

[@15:57](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=957.221) \- **Denise Shannon**

She also, um... And I was taking, was doing the call from home, and she had her computer at a level that she was constantly typing so you could see her hands.

Like, her hands were flying in the screen, and she never looked directly at us at any point.

[@16:18](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=978.661) \- **Stefanie Murray**

And the cat, and there was cats.

[@16:20](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=980.801) \- **Denise Shannon**

Yes, and we had a cat bombing, very funny lady. So, yeah, but I kind of like that. Yeah, You know, I'm like, yeah.

Yeah, No, she's a personality. So that was great. And then today, we actually met with two people, Andy and the event person from Point Park, and then three people from Duquesne were also on the call.

So for the size of our conference, Point Park can definitely accommodate, but they don't really have, like, communal, convening space, you know, to feed people.

**ACTION ITEM: Submit Duquesne event request form to Megan \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1018.9999)**

So. So. So Duquesne was excited about sharing what they could do, how we could work together. They gave us the event request form, so I'll get that back to Megan today.

And we're close enough to downtown where INN is going to run theirs out of the Wyndham with a much, much larger budget than we could ever dream of.

So there's a lot. We can still have a lot of crossover being in the same city and it only being within five miles maximum of each other.

So we'll, uh, we have that to pursue in both cases. We've, you know, let the individuals know that we really, really, really want to come to a decision, um, by the end of this week so, uh, we can get out.

And really start promoting this since we're about a solid month behind. Totally. More than that.

[@18:08](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1088.78) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Six weeks at least solid. And also, like, to be honest, like, and Amy and Liza and Delaney know this really well, these are both better options than the North Carolina one because, like, Andy's got so much going on in Pittsburgh with the partnership.

And they also are running, they were telling us about this, this whole new, like, university consortium. And then, obviously, clearly in Philly with Gene and, and all that work there.

I mean, these are both no-brainers with, like, easy stuff to highlight. So. Absolutely.

[@18:41](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1121.38) \- **Denise Shannon**

It feels better.

[@18:43](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1123.46) \- **Amy Maestas**

We gave a small stipend to folks in Pittsburgh. I'm sorry, did I miss, would it still be the same, so they're doing some work with journalists, same dates?

[@18:55](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1135.34) \- **Denise Shannon**

No, it would be, well, if it's. It's Philly. We gave them May dates, May 14th and 15th. If it's Pittsburgh, we just have to nail down.

I believe that Courtney wants to do, hold on, where's my calendar? She's looking at 15th, 16th, 17th in June.

[@19:24](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1164.52) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Is that what you're talking about?

[@19:25](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1165.14) \- **Denise Shannon**

Yeah, think she wants to be the 16th to the 18th, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. is when IRE is, too.

[@19:32](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1172.74) \- **Stefanie Murray**

It's like.

[@19:33](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1173.94) \- **Denise Shannon**

Right. So she, you know, wants to be wrapped up before the Juneteenth holiday. We would probably, you know, want to come in the 15th and 16th.

**ACTION ITEM: Schedule INN call w/ Shemeika re: Pittsburgh dates/logistics \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1183.9999)**

So we'd have to, you know, figure that out.

[@19:54](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1194.42) \- **Stefanie Murray**

So, Denise, I can't join that call up, too, because I have to join something with Lisa. So I'll. Oh.

[@20:00](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1200.0) \- **Denise Shannon**

Oh, I thought she meant that she couldn't do the call, but it'll probably be Shemeika.

[@20:05](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1205.78) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Okay. I thought she meant.

[@20:08](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1208.42) \- **Denise Shannon**

She wasn't on the, she wasn't on the IN. Okay, great.

[@20:13](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1213.28) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Okay. Andy's call.

[@20:14](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1214.38) \- **Denise Shannon**

Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. So, yeah, that's, that's where we are. Looking like Pennsylvania.

[@20:22](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1222.98) \- **Stefanie Murray**

We gotta, we gotta make a decision. East or West, we're not sure. That's right, we gotta make a decision on Monday.

And their prices, Denise is gonna look closer at their prices, but at, at first glance, they seemed comparable, but I think Temple would be cheaper because I think that we could, you know, I think that Gene and Luttrell and David Boardman would help get us some good space for cheaper.

We'd probably be on the hook mostly for tech and food. Right.

[@20:51](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1251.52) \- **Denise Shannon**

Cool.

[@20:52](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1252.42) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Okay. I think that's it.

[@20:55](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1255.84) \- **Denise Shannon**

So, we're making a decision. Making a decision. decision. Do you all want to talk about ECM Celebration? Yeah, let's do that next.

Take it away, Oni.

[@21:11](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1271.22) \- **Oni Advincula**

I thought you were going to take it away because you have more updates. Well, I can. Please, yeah, because actually it's more on your side, right?

Yeah. Okay.

[@21:23](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1283.26) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay, so our Ethnic and Community Media Luncheon Awards will be Thursday, February 26th. We're hosting that at TCNJ again and hopefully leveraging the proximity to Trenton to get a lot of folks there.

**ACTION ITEM: Email legislators re: ECM Celebration attendance \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1303.9999)**

Oni, I'm sure, can hopefully give us an update on our keynotes that he's been working on. And we have a big legislator list that we're going to.

You know, reach out to now that we have a date finalized. Stefanie, do you want me to go ahead and replicate the Eventbrite since I didn't see that Joe responded and we need to get that up and running too?

[@22:18](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1338.58) \- **Oni Advincula**

I uploaded it on Airtable.

[@22:21](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1341.6) \- **Denise Shannon**

Right, but the actual Eventbrite listing, we want to get that taken care of. Is she still with us? Probably not.

[@22:36](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1356.68) \- **Oni Advincula**

Right.

[@22:37](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1357.42) \- **Denise Shannon**

Yeah.

[@22:39](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1359.68) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Sorry, I didn't realize I was muted. I can hear myself through Liza and I thought y'all could hear me.

I said that I messaged Joe and let me see what he says. He's online right now.

[@22:51](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1371.82) \- **Denise Shannon**

Okay. He's messaging me.

[@22:53](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1373.24) \- **Stefanie Murray**

typing right now. Okay. He said he's working on that as we speak instead of sitting in these awful sessions.

Okay.

[@23:01](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1381.62) \- **Denise Shannon**

Sounds good. So, Oni, you want to talk about?

[@23:05](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1385.08) \- **Oni Advincula**

What about, if you don't mind, could you give us an update on the sponsors or potential sponsors? So, yes.

[@23:20](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1400.12) \- **Denise Shannon**

The long and short of it is we are too late. You guys are too late.

[@23:26](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1406.02) \- **Stefanie Murray**

You can't pitch out this close to an event.

[@23:29](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1409.42) \- **Denise Shannon**

I really expect to get anything back. It still was a good exercise for us to put a package together, and I think it's something that we should absolutely do going forward.

Stefanie did send a few emails yesterday, so we'll see if we get any interest. But in all likelihood, it'll, you know, it'll be, you know, Robert Wood Johnson funding that will, you know, that we'll use for the event.

And it is what it is. Yeah.

[@24:04](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1444.54) \- **Stefanie Murray**

But if we have any other, I mean, I only did outreach to that list that we had compiled. So if there's anyone else that we think of, totally ask.

And I'm happy to even, I was thinking about even just posting publicly, like, hey, if anyone's interested in supporting this, I could do that.

But I just, I unfortunately don't have a ton of time to do a lot of legwork right now to find more potential sponsors.

And since it's not going to be a huge cost, I'm not super worried about it. But I would like to defray it if we could.

[@24:41](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1481.5) \- **Oni Advincula**

Yeah, that would be great. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So in addition to that update, so we are planning to give five awards to ethnic media.

So four of them are... We call it the Champion Media Awards. So they are Radio Hornalera for the coverage on immigration and the Gaza conflict.

We're also giving one to Kata Radio, Radio Kata, for their news and information, specifically for farm workers in Vineland, New Jersey.

Very highly hyper-local, specifically for farm workers within that area. Also, we're giving it to Korea, the Korea Daily in New Jersey, for their election coverage, specifically on the senatorial when Senator Kim was running, and then also the gubernatorial elections.

And then the Lifetime Achievement Award, which we did give to Lusa America. Luz Americano last time. Luz Americano has been in operation for, I think, close to 100 years.

And we're giving it this time to a Polish newspaper. It's called Novigenic. They've been there. They've been around for 75 years reporting in New Jersey.

And then the last one that we're wanting to give it to is to, again, this is sort of like a very difficult process.

We're giving it to Frontrunner New Jersey, Sandra, Stefanie, please correct me if I'm wrong, for being a trailblazer in the African-American community.

It's one of the publications after all that Black newspapers closed down. Clyde, actually. We did establish this organization in 2017\.

So we wanted to honor that. And then, of course, the keynote, Senator Andy Kim, we already communicated with him.

They are aware of it, which is why we got a soft confirmation from the press secretary there. But, of course, anything can happen, and hopefully not.

And then the MSU Communications Department, they said they are willing to help us communicate with other legislators if Senator Kim will not be able to do it this year.

Stefanie, did I cover that right?

[@27:49](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1669.36) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Yes, yes, I said to get some water because I'm choking up. So, Amy, could you run things for me?

Or Cassandra, be right back. Oh, God, I hope you're okay.

[@28:00](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1680.0) \- **Oni Advincula**

Okay.

[@28:03](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1683.7) \- **Cassandra Etienne**

I can go next, Amy. That's okay. I don't have that many updates today. So I'm working with Oni to prep for the Not Your Same Old Sources press briefing on January 21st.

This one will focus on SNAP benefits and policy changes that will impact New Jersey families and looking at food insecurity in the state.

We have a great lineup of panelists. have Jamie, I hope I'm pronouncing her last name, Bustle, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Councilman Crystal Feliciano from Trenton, and the third person again.

Nina Plata Nino. From the FRAC, but I have, I'm forgetting the acronym. Food Research and Alliance Action, I think.

Thanks, Sony. So Thanks, We have prep calls scheduled with them. We just met with Council Member Feliciano yesterday, and she's great.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Joe re: NYSOS press briefing support \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1746.9999)**

We think she'll be a strong addition to the discussion. So that's coming along. We're just working on the assets for that on the back end.

And shortly, I'll be, and this is for Joe, too. I'll be reaching out to Joe to help with the event, right?

**ACTION ITEM: Coordinate w/ Amanda \+ Joe to launch Black Press Research Project around ECM Celebration \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1761.9999)**

But we have the, Oni and I have gone back and forth on the text. So we feel like it's at a pretty good place.

And hopefully, we can finalize and start promoting that soon. So we also, just in speaking about the Ethic and Community Media event, and the honorees, specifically Front Runner New Jersey, are considering teeing up the Black Press Research Project to be launched around that time.

So I think, I think that's a great suggestion from Stefanie. So I'll be working with Amanda. And Joe to help reach that goal and have, yeah, a launch shortly before or on the 26th, February.

And then other items within New Jersey News Commons continuing to push to increase our membership numbers. Of course, we don't want to boost the numbers just for the sake of boosting numbers, but I think it's really important that, especially those people who keep coming back again and again and have been regular partners with us who are not currently in who are not currently enrolled as members, I think it's important to just get them in and continue engaging with them.

So, continuing with that, I appreciate help from Oni and Amanda who have been helping with this also. So we're, yeah, I think we're at 330, think.

330 members. And then also looking at having three to four in-person events, smaller in-person events. So I've spoken with.

If a few of you about this, Denise in particular, we talked about the one to two trainings in collaboration with pro news coaches.

**ACTION ITEM: Schedule reconnect w/ Denise re: Pro News Coaches training at MSU \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1862.9999)**

So that's in the works in the background. They would really like to have the first event at MSU if we can.

So Denise, hopefully we can reconnect on that. think that got lost in the shuffle with going into the holidays.

I'd love to chat with you about that. And then I was talking with Stephanie about this a little bit yesterday, but looking at maybe a spring event and a summer event to bring people together, possibly the spring one, orienting around the investigative journalism cohort and the projects that hopefully will be published by then.

So we kind of like put a cap on that project, but also celebrate or recognize the work of the participating newsrooms.

Other things I could talk about, but I'll just focus. I'll just mention those.

[@32:06](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1926.7) \- **Stefanie Murray**

You see that side all you got from Denise? She had her pen in her hand and she goes, you said eventually.

I'm sorry, Denise.

[@32:16](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1936.24) \- **Cassandra Etienne**

I'm so sorry. They're just ideas right now, Denise.

[@32:21](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1941.12) \- **Denise Shannon**

It's a good thing Joe is not on the call. I know he gets to that point where he's going to like, a blood vessel is going to burn.

We knew we were going to plan these events, but now we're putting pen to paper. Yeah. Yeah.

[@32:33](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1953.04) \- **Cassandra Etienne**

The other thing is like, I recognize that it can be a strain on us, especially like being there physically conducting or managing the events.

But just looking at how maybe it's not like Joe doesn't feel as much of the pressure, just looking at how we can manage that.

Yeah.

[@32:55](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1975.2) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Partnering up with other things that are going to happen. Yeah. Like the CIC gathering and having. Stuff here midday because, you know, we're all here generally midday.

It's, you know, we're talking about stuff like that too. Right.

[@33:08](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=1988.56) \- **Cassandra Etienne**

Yeah, it's definitely helpful that like pro news coaches, want to team up on it. So that's helpful. Okay. All right.

[@33:20](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2000.24) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Cool. Anything else? All right. While I was choking in the bathroom in my post-nasal drip. Did anyone else get a Julie or Will or the Hub?

Either, whoever wants to go. Julie has one. quickly.

[@33:37](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2017.5) \- **Yuliana Delgado**

All right. Thanks, Oni. So I met with, talked to Oni earlier this week and Denise. And so we're gearing up to start the translations again.

[@33:50](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2030.26) \- **Stefanie Murray**

The translation service will come back.

[@33:53](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2033.32) \- **Yuliana Delgado**

We were talking about starting off next week, but we're going to do next week, probably two translations. Translation, so ease into it, so that we have a total of, I think that's going to be like two weeks in January, since we didn't get, I guess, as much as we had hoped for, and we're just going to cap it at around four translations weekly.

So, and then Denise and I will meet monthly just to go over sort of what the costs that the actuals versus what we budgeted, so we keep like a closer eye on it, since, you know, I know what gets assigned and how many we're doing weekly, so I think that that's a good process going forward.

**ACTION ITEM: Email translators re: translation service restart; assign 2 next week, then 4/wk rotating \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2065.9999)**

So, I'm excited, and I'm about, I'm going to send out an email to the translators probably tomorrow morning, just saying like, yay, we're going to come back.

**ACTION ITEM: Schedule monthly check-in w/ Denise re: translation costs vs budget \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2065.9999)**

The only thing is, since we have five translators and we're doing four, we're going to do the, just switching out weekly, so one of them won't have something for, you know, for, for.

For a week, month or so. So we'll do that. I'll make sure that it's done fairly so that we speak to everybody.

Right.

[@35:10](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2110.74) \- **Denise Shannon**

And hopefully we'll have some, you know, funding news on the horizon for the back half of the year.

[@35:17](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2117.3) \- **Yuliana Delgado**

Yes. But for now, I guess we operate, you know, as. Absolutely. Yeah.

[@35:23](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2123.7) \- **Denise Shannon**

That we don't have it. Yeah.

[@35:25](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2125.96) \- **Yuliana Delgado**

So. And. Yeah. And that's it for me. And then I was going to say, you know, Oni, if you need any help with outreach for the ECM, for anything, let me know.

**ACTION ITEM: Schedule meeting w/ Will to review final funding proposal \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2135.9999)**

Yeah.

[@35:52](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2152.4) \- **William Fischer**

We can review the final funding proposal. I think just for the holidays. I finished that up and I'm not sure.

I I sent it to you or Joe, but I want to make sure that's good before you send it off.

[@36:03](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2163.54) \- **Stefanie Murray**

was totally down with the flu like that Monday before Christmas until recently.

[@36:07](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2167.58) \- **William Fischer**

So I didn't look at anything. Sorry.

[@36:09](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2169.18) \- **Stefanie Murray**

No worries.

[@36:10](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2170.4) \- **William Fischer**

But yeah, that should be almost good to go. So we'll just finalize that so we can start circulating it.

Yeah. And then I just got to do kind of dive in a bunch more research on funders and who else we want to reach out to and how we're going to do it.

So I just got to dive into that now that it's the new year.

[@36:28](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2188.48) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Excellent. Any job news in Cali?

[@36:31](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2191.66) \- **William Fischer**

Not yet, but in a few things with us and like universities around here too. So it hasn't been nothing.

that's good. All right.

[@36:40](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2200.98) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Let us know if you need help. Thanks.

[@36:42](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2202.88) \- **William Fischer**

Amazing.

[@36:44](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2204.1) \- **Stefanie Murray**

And last but not least, the Collaborative Journalism Resource Hub. Okay.

[@36:50](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2210.22) \- **Amy Maestas**

Well, we submitted the hub's very first report to the night for our year one. Thank you very much to to Delaney.

Amy, Liza, Stefanie, and Denise for all of their help and some last-minute help in getting this all together. We learned, but I mean, we knew a lot because we worked with Knight before, but I feel like it's a very good reporting for our first year, succeeding in what we told Knight we would do.

And I think we ended with nearly 60 intake forms and calls that we had over the year with people.

Some of them yielded some activity, some did not. We are, a deliverable is that we helped catalyze four collaboratives per year over the five-year length of the grant.

We ended the year not with the fourth one solidified because of one that we thought was going to work out, did not work out.

And then... Our backup, this was a little slow given the holidays and decisions, but today I did notify Mike Killian, who has a part of overseeing the New York Police Accountability Collaborative, along with Syracuse University and Gannett, that we are funding them and that they're technically that fourth collaborative.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Mike Killian (NY Police Accountability Collaborative) re: Joe AI support \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2297.9999)**

Um, and so they're doing some really great stuff. might bring Joe in to talk to them about AI. They really want to incorporate AI into their project.

Um, and they're getting some funding from, I think Gannett has a foundation stuff. So anyway, we're excited about that.

Um, we are, um, I think we're starting off the, the, the year really strong with potentials for the four collaboratives.

And we are also starting off with our monthly webinar. Our series, the first one will be January, I think it's 27th, or the last Tuesday in January, and Emily Dressler, formerly of Texas Tribune, and some other news organizations will be leading that on how collaboratives can work with, accept, think about sponsorships, particularly corporate sponsorships, the guidelines around that ethics, editorial standards, how to think about that.

And then next month will be Claudia Laws from Georgia's Media in Louisiana, talking about how collaboratives can go after small donor dollars.

Instead of putting all your hopes in these big grants and big, you know, numbers, I can get the locally the small.

So we've got a good lineup, more topics for this year than we will be able to accommodate doing it once a month.

But, of course, open to... Pivoting on anything, so if anybody has ideas or wants to introduce us to somebody with an idea or wants to host, please do let us know.

We will have our first newsletter. How many years did Mariella do the Collaborative Journalism newsletter? Stefanie, do you know off the top of your head?

Four years? Oh, wow. think seven.

[@40:24](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2424.74) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Seven years.

[@40:25](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2425.66) \- **Amy Maestas**

Okay. Six or seven years.

[@40:27](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2427.88) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Yeah. Hang on. I just did a letter of recommendation for her, and I had to count this.

[@40:32](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2432.84) \- **Amy Maestas**

Okay.

[@40:36](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2436.82) \- **Stefanie Murray**

I'll get back to you in a second. Okay.

[@40:38](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2438.58) \- **Amy Maestas**

I just want to acknowledge her in the newsletter that comes out this week and thank her for the years that she did that newsletter.

She will not be doing the newsletter anymore. She will be a contributor. We will have a monthly feature that we call Still This Idea.

I think that's a working title, maybe. don't Delaney keeps telling me that. It's best to just leave it alone, but basically she'll be reaching out and doing a short Q\&A with collaboratives who have a successful idea and ask them how they executed this idea so that other collaboratives can take away and like, oh, we might want to replicate that.

[@41:18](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2478.76) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Six years, Amy, six years. Thank you.

[@41:21](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2481.02) \- **Amy Maestas**

That's fun.

[@41:22](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2482.74) \- **Denise Shannon**

Yeah.

[@41:23](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2483.2) \- **Amy Maestas**

So something useful and good ideas for, we'll ask people to submit ideas to like, hey, we did this successfully with some, we'll start off with talking about how collaboratives can celebrate a project, the wrap up of a project and incorporate the community in that celebration so that they're, you know, with the Wichita collaborative did that when they ended their affordable housing series and they had a community party about that so that it elevated their journalism so a bunch of ideas there so Delaney and I will be taking.

Speaking on that newsletter. And we will have one this week. The bulk of it this week will be me saying, here are some changes coming.

Here's what you can look forward to. Here's how we want to hear from you. And we'll promote our January webinar.

And yeah, and then we'll get back into it. Um, it's, it's not going to be radically different, but it is going to be different enough and, and, uh, that people will hopefully notice that we, the subscription list has been stagnant for a long time now.

Um, so the hope is that we can grow that, um, list and, um, we actually have a really low bounce back rate for people who are, um, signed up, but no longer with the organization or something like that.

So that's good. It's just getting people to click, um, click through. And. And then we have meetings set up, Liza's working on a proposal for the Gates Foundation, Delaney, Liza, help me out here.

What else do we have? We have a lot going on. just trying to.

[@43:22](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2602.93) \- **Liza Gross**

Yeah, just to mention that the meeting or the resumption of Miami Collaborative will start next week because guess what?

They are consumed in Miami with what's going on in Venezuela.

[@43:37](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2617.6) \- **Stefanie Murray**

So they are a little bit verklempt about that.

[@43:40](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2620.26) \- **Liza Gross**

And so next week we are going to resume the meetings. They have done some reporting already. So that's good news.

And Amy, I also wanted to point out something regarding Mike Killian for the team to know. Mike Killian started with Solutions Journalism Network with a pilot project that we did.

funded by the Ralph C. Wilson Foundation. He'd never done solutions journalism before. He'd never done collaboration before. And now, you know, he has, seven years later, he really has a fantastic project that shows such sophistication and understanding of how to put together a collaborative.

And they are doing it on police databases, nothing to do now with the Ralph C. Wilson Foundation anymore, or that topic.

But it's really heartening to see that legacy executives, know, legacy news executives can really do a big transformation, can undergo a big transformation if they really stick with it and see the possibilities of new ways of doing journalism.

[@44:50](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2690.57) \- **Amy Maestas**

Yeah, and they, they were, at the beginning of this year, they were kind of like swirling, like, oh, we don't know what to do, we don't know to do.

And they, we, with, Great leadership led them through an impact pack, an exercise to help them focus, and they really succeeded at that and came out on the side with a really great proposal, so we're looking forward to that.

I will note that we have all three of our new collaboratives, and we'll see if we can get New York on this timeline too, we'll be publicly announcing that they're a collaborative and funded by the Hub on January 13th, is that right Delaney, or 15th?

The Central Florida, and the Wilmington, North Carolina collaboratives, and hopefully with Liza's urging, we can get Miami to be prepared.

[@45:44](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2744.47) \- **Liza Gross**

Yeah, they already announced, they already said that we can go ahead with an announcement.

[@45:48](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2748.5) \- **Amy Maestas**

Okay.

[@45:48](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2748.82) \- **Liza Gross**

We just need to write it up and make sure that we reflect who the latest partners are and what exactly they are doing.

[@45:57](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2757.71) \- **Amy Maestas**

Okay. So. The Wilmington, I think the Wilmington and the Central Florida have created press releases. The PR person in Central Florida changed my quote that I gave her, put words in my mouth.

We put the kibosh on that. Yeah, she did. She did ask if it was okay.

[@46:22](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2782.73) \- **Delaney Butler**

And we said no.

[@46:23](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2783.86) \- **Amy Maestas**

Yeah, she did ask. I mean, I'll give her that much. She asked. But, you know, but on receiving end of that, of somebody saying, you know, I gave you an actual quote and you changed my actual quote.

was like weird to be on the other side of that. So, but we're, so we'll, we'll publicly announce those mid January and be working with when Joe gets back on some technical side of stuff.

Um, getting. I'm set up for things and I will be there in the first week of February for the strategic session and Delaney and Liza and I will be making a trip to Philly to meet with the folks there and the new setup of the Philadelphia Journalism Collaborative.

**ACTION ITEM: Book flight for Miami forum \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2828.9999)**

I'm in on to Miami for the forum. Anything I missed? I gotta book my flight for that.

[@47:28](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2848.55) \- **Stefanie Murray**

I guess it's it for my end.

[@47:31](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2851.81) \- **Delaney Butler**

We'll have Carrie Porter's work with the impact tracking kind of like probably ramping up, especially first half of this year, especially with newer folks coming, like newer collaboratives coming on.

Carrie will be working really closely with them and we'll start seeing, I think, more of that like kind of cohesive impact stuff coming out of those.

Carrie be working working really well. well. really Carrie really well. well. Thank That was the main thing.

[@48:02](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=2882.79) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Any other travel anyone else coming up? So Amy, Liza, and I are going to KMF in February. I'm going at the end of the month to the Google Publisher Summit, and so is Jarvis in Austin.

It's going overnight for a quick day. Then there's a local journalism researchers convening that I might have to go to in D.C.

in March. That's pretty much the only thing on my calendar. What about anyone else? Anyone else going to any conferences?

You just reminded me, it's a good point. If you're thinking about going to a conference, make sure you talk to your manager and or me soon so that Denise and I can make sure that we have the money in the right spot budgeted for you.

Because we do try to always make sure that CCM has representation at big conferences, especially if you are someone who has not been to a conference recently, or if there's something you've always wanted to go to, please, we have travel money for this sort of thing.

It is important for us to be at some of these events. So if anyone has anything, let us know.

If we decouple from INN and they go to Pittsburgh and we go to Philadelphia, someone should attend INN. Yes.

True. Okay, cool. Oh, along that line too. If you're a member of any organization and your membership is coming up for renewal, make sure that we know about that so we can make sure that's budgeted properly.

And we can use the P-Card to pay for that. So that is like if you are a member of AAJA, ONA, any memberships.

We try to pay for at least one, memberships of everyone on staff for organizations that are important to them, sometimes more.

I think at one point Joe was a member of like eight organizations. Some of the dues are pretty low.

Make sure that I know that we can use the P-Card. That way it just avoids you having to reimburse, pay for yourself, and then blah, blah, blah, blah, so.

Cool. All right, anything else? Joe is in bed, you guys. He is working in his hotel bed. Oh, he's not sick, though?

[@50:21](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=3021.89) \- **Amy Maestas**

No, he's not sick.

[@50:22](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=3022.81) \- **Stefanie Murray**

He decided to not go to the morning session.

[@50:24](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=3024.99) \- **Amy Maestas**

Okay. I was like, you, can you do the event right?

[@50:28](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=3028.29) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Are you really busy? He's like, no, I got it. working on it now. He's like, I'm actually sitting in bed.

I was like, well, we got some stuff for you to do, sir, if you're going to sit in bed in Arizona and skip the morning session.

So if anyone needs anything from Joe, he's available right now.

[@50:46](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=3046.77) \- **Denise Shannon**

Cool. And he'll be back there this week.

[@50:49](https://fathom.video/share/yqjYSDrzY5BZzZ8mmjNHuu1G9235zp2d?timestamp=3049.33) \- **Stefanie Murray**

Okay. Great. Well, have a good rest of the day. Nice to see everyone in 2026\. May this year be better.

May this year rain grant funding down upon us. Um, and hope you guys have a good afternoon. You too.

everybody. Bye, everyone. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
