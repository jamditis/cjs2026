- **William Pitt Union:** Multiple flexible spaces
- **Academic presence:** Media & Professional Communications program

- **Potential use:** Possible off-site sustainability workshop or retreat, but not main venue

---

## Key considerations for venue selection

### Academic fit
- **Duquesne** and **Point Park** have the strongest journalism/media programs
- Hosting at a journalism school creates natural partnerships and student engagement opportunities
- Student media infrastructure (radio, TV, newspapers) could provide coverage and documentation

### Capacity & configuration
- **200-400 attendees** requires flexible spaces
- Need: 1 large plenary space (400+) + multiple breakout rooms (50-100 each)
- **Duquesne Power Center** and **CMU Rangos** best fit this model
- **Pitt Connolly Ballroom** also suitable but requires multiple buildings for breakouts

### Location & logistics
- **Oakland universities** (Pitt, CMU, Duquesne): Clustered together, excellent transit, multiple hotels
- **Point Park downtown**: Urban setting, walking to restaurants/nightlife, different atmosphere
- **Transit:** All Oakland + downtown options have 28X Airport Flyer access
- **Hotels:** Oakland has 3-4 university-adjacent hotels; downtown has 15+ options

### Summer scheduling
- **June 8-9, 2026** falls during summer sessions at all universities
- **Lower campus activity** = better availability
- **CMU restriction:** External events preferred outside academic year (may be issue)
- **June 19:** Juneteenth (all universities closed) — not a conflict for June 8-9

### Budget considerations
- **No public pricing** for any venue (all require quotes)
- **External event fees** apply to non-university groups
- **Non-profit rates:** May be available; ask specifically
- **Compare quotes:** Contact all top-tier options for competitive pricing

### Journalism summit theme alignment
- **Center for Media Innovation (Point Park):** Glass studios, newsroom, visual media hub aesthetic
- **CEIM at Duquesne:** Professional collaboration space, student media outlets
- **Pitt Media & Professional Communications:** Hands-on experience, corporate/media company internships
- **Sustainability angle (Chatham):** If environmental journalism is a theme, Eden Hall could be a workshop location

---
