[VIEW RECORDING \- 27 mins (No highlights)](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi)

## Meeting Purpose

[Finalize the joint conference venue and high-level schedule.](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?tab=summary&timestamp=19.0)

## Key Takeaways

* [Venue: UNC-Chapel Hill is the top choice due to newly available June dates and highly affordable pricing (\~$80–$90/day per attendee), which includes meals and allows for external vendors.](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?tab=summary&timestamp=961.0)  
* [Backup Venues: Pittsburgh and Louisville are the top backups. Pittsburgh is preferred for its existing collaborative ecosystem (Andy Conte's work), while Louisville is a strong option for its favorable numbers.](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?tab=summary&timestamp=169.0)  
* [Schedule: The proposed schedule compacts the CJS summit into a single day (Monday or Tuesday) to improve attendee flow for those attending both events.](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?tab=summary&timestamp=454.0)  
* [Logistics: Receptions will likely require an off-campus venue, as UNC's convention center is not designed for evening events. A shared venue for both receptions is a strong possibility.](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?tab=summary&timestamp=827.0)

[VIEW RECORDING \- 27 mins (No highlights)](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi)

[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=0.0) \- Courtney  
Wrong Zoom. Just sitting there waiting for y'all by myself. And over agenda, does anyone else have items they want to add for us to talk about?

[@0:12](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=12.82) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
I thought that looked great.

[@0:13](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=13.9) \- Courtney  
Thank you for doing that, Courtney. Do that? Okay. Let's jump right in since we've got 30 minutes. So update on venues.  
I think last time we talked, I was sharing how we were trying to go for UNC, and then they came back and said they only have a July date, and that sort of triggered us to say, I was actually going to move on that, and then internally, people had a very similar reaction to you all, which was like earlier, so much more preferred.  
So what we did was send out a...

[@0:53](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=53.1) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Basically a wide call for proposals.

[@0:54](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=54.72) \- Courtney  
Oh, like, oh yeah. got, yeah. And we got, like, the way Shamika did it, ended up getting like... So many proposals, which took us a while to sort of sit through.  
We got 40, we narrowed that down to 15, and then narrowed that even further down to the six or five or six that I sent you all.

[@1:12](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=72.24) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep, yep.

[@1:12](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=72.9) \- Courtney  
And then in the meantime, UNC, Duquesne, we were talking to, but I haven't heard back yet. And then in the meantime, UNC came back to us and said, hey, we have June dates.  
ACTION ITEM: Visit UNC venue Nov 19; send Slack notes/photos to Stefanie/Denise/Joe/Kemuel; if go, book UNC \+ hotel block \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=82.9999)

[@1:23](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=83.6) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
And we were like, oh. we were surprised to see that on your spreadsheet.

[@1:26](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=86.5) \- Courtney  
Like, that's amazing. And we were super excited about that. And so I said, okay, we'll hold them for us.  
I'm coming to see you next week. So as of now, I'm going to visit them tomorrow. My impression is, like, if it works, I think we should move on it.  
But the other options, I did want to at least discuss should anything happen so that we know what on that list you all would entertain.  
Because I know you all had certain criteria. And so, you CWNC is the leading option when you look at the numbers and you look at the location, you look at all the things.

[@2:04](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=124.5) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
We were so happy to see that, Courtney. We met about this this morning.

[@2:07](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=127.54) \- Courtney  
Yep. Us too. So I'll take a look at it. I'll, you know, send notes and pictures. And if that's a go, we'll probably move fairly quickly on it.

[@2:20](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=140.02) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Great.

[@2:21](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=141.08) \- Courtney  
And if it's not, I want it to, or even if, I just want to know, like, if there's anything on that list you would not go to, so that we can just move quickly if something doesn't work.

[@2:31](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=151.86) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
are are you flying there?

[@2:32](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=152.8) \- Courtney  
Are you there right now? Are you flying there tomorrow? I'm flying there like early in the morning and then I'm going and then I'm going to check the venue.  
I'm going to check the hotel that we would book rooms for, room block for, and then I'm flying back.

[@2:45](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=165.9) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Like, oh, it'll be like one day in and out. Okay. Yeah. I mean, our, like our, our, early thoughts are that, um, we would prefer not to go to Reno, to Nevada or Texas.

[@2:58](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=178.82) \- Courtney  
Okay.

[@2:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=179.66) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Although. Although. Although the, you know, the room rate in Reno is pretty good. There's just not, because we try to go to places where there's some sort of collaboration happening, there's not a ton in those places.  
So those would be the bottom of our list. So the top of our list would really be North Carolina and then Pittsburgh because of what's already happening there.

[@3:19](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=199.12) \- Courtney  
Okay.

[@3:19](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=199.62) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
We didn't really talk too much about Louisville, but.

[@3:21](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=201.66) \- Courtney  
What about Louisville?

[@3:22](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=202.52) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay. Louisville, mean, could potentially work. You've been there. It's not the most exciting city. There's a couple of things to do.  
But I would say that our, we totally prefer UNC or Pittsburgh, like hands down over the others.

[@3:37](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=217.84) \- Courtney  
Okay. That's good to know. We'll still work Duquesne. I may press them even more if I don't, if Toronto doesn't end up working well, but.

[@3:47](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=227.32) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay.

[@3:47](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=227.86) \- Courtney  
That's good to know. I think our second option was Louisville because we're looking mostly at like numbers, but I don't think anything would stop us from also like, like just putting Pittsburgh.

[@3:58](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=238.88) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
I mean, they're, they're so similar. I They are very similar, yeah. Our only issue is that like there is a collaborative work that Andy Conte works on in Pittsburgh.

[@4:08](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=248.58) \- Courtney  
That's what gives it the edge in my mind.

[@4:10](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=250.28) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Synergy. That's kind of what puts them over the edge.

[@4:12](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=252.68) \- Courtney  
Okay. And I think we'd be fine with working through that.

[@4:16](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=256.0) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But if it's like, no, we got to do a Louisville, I think we could deal with Louisville.

[@4:20](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=260.54) \- Courtney  
Okay. And I think we're the same way with Pittsburgh. Yep. Okay. So that, that helps me. So now I have a top three.  
UNC, Louisville, and Pittsburgh are sort of tied. Awesome. One of those three will work just based on the numbers along.

[@4:34](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=274.9) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yes. And I'm glad to see the dates to our all June.

[@4:37](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=277.9) \- Courtney  
Yeah. That's exciting. Yeah. That's a win. Yeah. Total win. The perk with Pittsburgh is I'm here, so it will be really easy.  
would be nice. to plan.

[@4:47](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=287.72) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
We could ship everything to your house.

[@4:49](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=289.62) \- Courtney  
A whole garage full of t-shirts and swag. Yep. That's what happened when we were in D.C.

[@4:54](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=294.76) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
because I ended up driving there. Oh, yeah. Yep. Yep. Yeah. So that's the nice thing about us for Pittsburgh.  
Cause we could, it's easy for us to drive there. Super easy. We could drive Louisville too. mean, we drove to Chicago, um, but yeah.  
Okay, cool. Fantastic.

[@5:10](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=310.66) \- Courtney  
Um, so with that, let's talk a point in schedule. Cause, um, I had a chance to talk internally about everything.

[@5:21](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=321.76) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep.

[@5:22](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=322.54) \- Courtney  
I'm gonna pull up the, yeah, I'm looking, you sent us that screenshot. Yeah. I'm going to pull it up if that's helpful.

[@5:29](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=329.44) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah. So, so you guys would, um, so we had anticipated, um, our, most of the summit would be on, our summit would be on Monday with a reception with, we would have a reception Monday night was our initial thinking.  
SCREEN SHARING: Courtney started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=341.55157)  
And then Tuesday we would do a little bit in the morning, but that would probably be about it. And then people would be free until they go to the evening.  
Evening reception, the INN evening reception.

[@6:04](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=364.3) \- Courtney  
So, um, or were you thinking that we would do a joint reception? You're, you're saying that this Wednesday morning is a, no, Tuesday morning.  
Okay. If it's a, we have a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, we have a pad, we have an option to do a Monday through.  
With UNC, we have the whole week open.

[@6:31](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=391.54) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep.

[@6:32](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=392.16) \- Courtney  
So we could do a Tuesday, Friday pattern or a Monday, Thursday. think I would prefer if it's going to be an, if basically you're saying this should actually be on the day before and this is a half day.  
Let me just pull up the air table. Yeah, yep, yep.

[@6:45](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=405.24) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So what we were originally thinking is that we would do CJS on Monday and then a couple of, like, just a couple of smaller workshops Tuesday morning.  
Leading into INN. Okay. But, um. Okay. But, I mean, Denise, we could also consider, if, Courtney, if you guys are going to Tuesday, like your pre-conference workshops, eight to four, how many people, like, is that like a lot of people are going to that, or is that like a small invite only?

[@7:16](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=436.96) \- Courtney  
Our goal this year, not like a ton, our goal this year was to try to make that more, like last year, I think we had 125 attendees, but this is out of 400 and.

[@7:28](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=448.36) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, okay.

[@7:30](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=450.14) \- Courtney  
You know what mean? Yeah. So, our goal would be to.

[@7:34](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=454.88) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So, maybe we actually, Denise, what if we did a dinner Monday night, and then the summit Tuesday during the day, and then when it ends, people go to the INN reception?

[@7:49](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=469.04) \- Denise Shannon  
Hmm.

[@7:50](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=470.28) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Just flipping it a little bit. Right. Because that way, people who, I don't want people who want to go to both to have to be sitting around most of Tuesday doing nothing.

[@8:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=480.001) \- Denise Shannon  
Right.

[@8:02](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=482.401) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So, Courtney, this actually works. Your schedule, I think, actually will work fine for us, how you have this, except Monday night.  
Like, yeah.

[@8:13](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=493.401) \- Courtney  
You have a reception here?

[@8:15](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=495.601) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, yeah. So what we would do is we would have, like, some hands-on workshops Monday afternoon, like 1 to 4, and then our dinner would be 6 to 8 Monday night.

[@8:29](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=509.261) \- Denise Shannon  
And then we would do all of our programming Tuesday and all of our programming Tuesday. I mean that?

[@8:36](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=516.841) \- Courtney  
I feel like either could work.

[@8:40](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=520.381) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
That, to me, lets people fly in on Monday.

[@8:43](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=523.541) \- Courtney  
This will be better for attendees who want to go to both because they were able to compact it. But I think the other way it could work, the other way it could work, too, in the sense that what we would call Tuesday is, like, a day of workshops.  
Like, CJS has workshops.

[@8:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=539.361) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
We have workshops.

[@9:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=540.0) \- Courtney  
It's like a bunch workshops and like, it's just the thing for like people, it will be an exhaustive experience for people who are flying in Sunday, there all day for four days, you know, like, yeah, that's like, we've not.

[@9:15](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=555.38) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, I mean, that's the only thing is we will lose some people who are going to need to be locked in at the INN pre-conference workshops all day.

[@9:26](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=566.3) \- Courtney  
Yeah, but I think our plan is for us to be really strategic about that in terms of topic and target.  
And then, again, like, we can do it in a way that's not competitive. Like, I think, you know, people will ultimately have to decide, but I think we can figure out a way to come up with, like, some really strong topics that make it very clear to people.  
Like, This is for this person, that is for that person. Like, so for example, you said development professionals, you kind of want at the summit, then what we might do here is like board development conversations or something like that.

[@10:11](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=611.841) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

[@10:13](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=613.141) \- Courtney  
We could put audience conversations here.

[@10:15](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=615.101) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
I don't know. We have, we will have to work it out. We can work that out.

[@10:17](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=617.741) \- Courtney  
Yeah, we could totally work that out. is like, it's the pre-day, it's not the actual conference.

[@10:21](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=621.381) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So it's, we're a lot more flexible.

[@10:23](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=623.561) \- Courtney  
Like this, I was also thinking like, we could bring in partners like Canva may want to do a workshop, or Blue Lena, like it can also be something that's not necessarily ours, you know, so.

[@10:36](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=636.201) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep, yep, yep. Or we could also like do our keynotes in our, you know, like a keynote Monday afternoon and a couple, you know, one or two of the panel discussions Monday afternoon leading into the reception.  
And then Tuesday is a day of workshops, workshop driven.

[@10:54](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=654.541) \- Courtney  
We did that last year with INN Days and it worked well.

[@10:58](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=658.601) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
We started like at 3pm.

[@11:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=660.001) \- Courtney  
And did the first panel, and then the second day we went straight into breakouts, like there was no panel at the, at the, camp.  
ACTION ITEM: Email Anthropic re: Claude workshop collaboration \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=660.9999)  
Yeah.

[@11:10](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=670.701) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
What did you say, Joe?

[@11:11](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=671.221) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
Speaking of workshops, at the risk of opening a can of worms here, if Canva might be willing to do a workshop, I would wonder if something like Anthropic might be able to do, like collaborating with Claude kind of a thing, a workshop there.  
Just by thinking of that, just because that starts with a C, but should I explore that as well?

[@11:34](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=694.381) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Could you maybe put some feelers out? You should, yeah.

[@11:36](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=696.441) \- Courtney  
Yeah, why not? I think this idea of giving people a menu of workshops is actually cool.

[@11:42](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=702.141) \- Joe Amditis (Montclair State U)  
So I have to jump and do office hours for a student. Yeah, go ahead. I'll leave my note taker so I can catch up.  
You just dropped some worms and took off, we get it. Yeah.

[@11:49](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=709.581) \- Denise Shannon  
it.

[@11:50](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=710.681) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
All right. Yeah. Okay, let's think about.

[@11:53](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=713.961) \- Courtney  
And let's not lock this in, you know, we probably need to have another, conversation, like.

[@11:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=719.221) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, we got it. Think about it.

[@12:01](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=721.261) \- Courtney  
Maybe even next Monday, because we want to go out with a save the date as soon as we sign the contract.  
And so we should talk, once we know, we should talk Monday and sort of lock this down because we don't need to say what is going to happen.  
But we do want to say INN days is this date to this date. CJS is this date to this date.  
We kind of just need just one sentence liner. And then we have time to get ourselves in order before registration opens.

[@12:29](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=749.601) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep. Yep. I like this. I actually, this, this looks good to me, Denise, let people fly in Monday morning.  
Right. And then, you know, we have a keynote that's at two or three with maybe a panel discussion or two.  
And then we go into dinner and have a second keynote at dinner.

[@12:49](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=769.001) \- Courtney  
And I think that we would, if we did this, we would probably nix this reception. Because we thought this was serving your purpose and we could join, but like what we would do is probably have.  
Have, just lead with any, and make, um, Kim had the idea of, instead of a reception, we would just have, like, a grazing snack bar type of thing, but not, like, a formal, so, we, or maybe we would put that here instead.

[@13:20](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=800.541) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep, yep.

[@13:22](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=802.821) \- Courtney  
Yeah, that's probably how we would do it. Put the social, yeah. Put the casual social here. Um, I don't know.

[@13:38](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=818.421) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
We'd have to figure that out.

[@13:39](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=819.561) \- Courtney  
Yeah, Um, so, actually, I don't want to move that. Okay, yeah. can we talk reception real quick?

[@13:48](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=828.901) \- Denise Shannon  
Yep, let's talk about that.

[@13:49](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=829.901) \- Courtney  
Sure. So, one thing's, one thing I'm definitely going to be scanning for when I'm at UNC is that they, it's like a convention center.

[@13:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=839.221) \- Denise Shannon  
Right.

[@14:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=840.002) \- Courtney  
Right. Not a hotel. So because of that, the idea of a reception is kind of odd because it's not like a vibe.  
ACTION ITEM: Email UNC venue re: evening reception feasibility/cost, plated vs buffet, external vendors, nearby hotels \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=849.9999)  
They don't have like, they typically don't do evening at reception, she said, but they can, it would be an added cost to do all that.  
I'll get the questions tomorrow. We might should meet later this week, like maybe Thursday or Friday, actually, before Monday.  
But needless to say, so I think that even for what we're thinking for our reception and possibly even any's is probably doing that at a different venue.  
So when you say you have space in mind or you're just going to don't, we'll have to find it, feel it out once you're done.  
What would fit any's probably would fit your reception too. Yeah, we do have to find it. So, but, you know, we're in, we're on UNC's.  
Campus. So I feel confident that we'll find.

[@15:05](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=905.022) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
You're going to look for that. You're going to, you're going ask them about that tomorrow, though.

[@15:08](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=908.082) \- Courtney  
I'm going to talk about that tomorrow, see what they think. And then Shameka will have to, like, if I go there and I'm like, oh no, this could easily be made into a night event.  
You know, we do it like, for instance, if there's an auditorium right off the entrance and, you know, but if you're, if people are walking through an empty conference center to get to, it just doesn't have the same vibe.  
So, um, I'm going to feel, I'm feeling that out.

[@15:32](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=932.562) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Let's say it that way.

[@15:33](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=933.402) \- Courtney  
I'm feeling it out.

[@15:34](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=934.422) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Um, but my assumption is that we probably are going to have to search for, uh, okay. How big of a space do you guys need for the innies?  
Like how big are you?

[@15:43](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=943.902) \- Courtney  
It's about the same size as your event.

[@15:46](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=946.002) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Probably 150 people. Yeah. Yeah.

[@15:48](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=948.582) \- Courtney  
I think probably a hundred, 200\. Like if we find something, it might work for both.

[@15:52](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=952.882) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep. We can lock it in for both.

[@15:54](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=954.582) \- Courtney  
Okay. Yeah. Possible. But it would be like a sort of separate agreement, separate

[@16:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=960.002) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay.

[@16:01](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=961.462) \- Courtney  
And then so you know like the cost for UNC only include daytime dining so any nighttime is actually a la carte.  
We would have to be doing that with them anyway is what I'm trying to say.

[@16:15](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=975.442) \- Denise Shannon  
So it wouldn't count toward the food and beverage minimums or?

[@16:21](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=981.982) \- Courtney  
UNC is different because they actually even though the chart says minimum they actually don't have a food and beverage minimum.

[@16:28](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=988.002) \- Denise Shannon  
Oh, okay.

[@16:29](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=989.502) \- Courtney  
have a day rate per attendee. I think it's like $80 to $90 and it includes a whole meal package.

[@16:37](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=997.442) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay.

[@16:38](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=998.502) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
So it's extremely affordable. Yeah, that's great. That's where a breakfast, lunch, Exactly. Right.

[@16:46](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1006.88) \- Courtney  
And the menu is not as customizable because they like, which is fine, you know, but at the same time, like it's going to be super affordable for us in the sense that we could, and they're open to us bringing in.  
And external vendors. we work, we just have to work through them. But like, if we're like, oh, but we want, you know, North Carolina pizza to come with the food truck, like we can do that.

[@17:09](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1029.66) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
But the great thing about it is it's so affordable.

[@17:12](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1032.72) \- Courtney  
It lends to a lot of flexibility for enhancing the reception or enhancing the snack bar or like, but the reception event is still something we're going to have to think of separately.  
And so, you know, an extra $5,000 for a better venue may be worth it if we're going to net out on food and beverage anyway, or.  
Gotcha. Are you thinking plated dinner or are you thinking? Yes. Okay. I don't even think they do that evening.  
Okay. Yeah. So I'll ask.

[@17:47](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1067.24) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
All right. I mean, if we had to do a buffet, we could do buffet, but I'd prefer plated.

[@17:52](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1072.02) \- Courtney  
Yeah. Okay. You want a plated dinner for 150 people.

[@17:56](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1076.24) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, probably more like a hundred, I would imagine.

[@17:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1079.1) \- Courtney  
Okay.

[@17:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1079.68) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay. But yeah, if it's buffet, we do buffet too.

[@18:02](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1082.4) \- Courtney  
That's fine.

[@18:03](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1083.08) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
If the cost difference is wild, then I don't want to do buffet because I don't want to pay.

[@18:09](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1089.18) \- Courtney  
I mean, if anything, you could do that.

[@18:11](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1091.68) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
You could do that at a hotel.

[@18:13](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1093.48) \- Courtney  
There are nearby hotels and you can do that event at a hotel. So I think we'll have flexibility. We'll have options.  
If we're at a hotel, it'll all be one full swoop.

[@18:26](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1106.26) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah.

[@18:28](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1108.08) \- Courtney  
And that's easy because the environment, we just, you know, with signage and lighting and everything kind of changed the mood.

[@18:36](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1116.62) \- Denise Shannon  
But right.

[@18:39](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1119.04) \- Courtney  
Okay. What else did I have on the agenda?  
ACTION ITEM: Draft save-the-date messaging in Slack for Courtney/Denise/Joe/Kemuel \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1127.9999)

[@18:48](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1128.56) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah. Reception, save the date, messaging.

[@18:57](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1137.28) \- Courtney  
Oh, right.

[@18:57](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1137.92) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah. We can work. I can work on that in Slack. Thank you. Drop some potential things that we can consider.  
And then I think we should meet next Monday. And then the next thing on our list, too, is ticketing and pitches.  
Because we're going to open a pitch form, and we will want to make sure that we, you know, work on that together.

[@19:19](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1159.08) \- Courtney  
want to use the same pitch form, basically?

[@19:21](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1161.02) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Is that what we're saying? We could do that, too. That's fine with me.

[@19:25](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1165.7) \- Courtney  
I don't have a preference.

[@19:27](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1167.38) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
It doesn't matter, you know, to me either really way. We usually do ours through Airtable, but we could, you know, do it a different way, too.  
We could do it in a Google Sheet and feed it in.

[@19:39](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1179.86) \- Courtney  
We're totally flexible with that. I think the one thing I'm trying to – registration is another thing.

[@19:48](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1188.0) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah, how do you – that was my other next thing. How do you guys do registration now?

[@19:51](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1191.34) \- Courtney  
What do you use? Kim, you want to share on that one?

[@19:57](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1197.38) \- Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)  
Yeah, so essentially we – Yeah. We have an entire, like, AMS system now, or INN has an entire AMS system now.

[@20:06](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1206.48) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
What's AMS?

[@20:08](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1208.68) \- Courtney  
It's like a CRM, but it's an associate management software.

[@20:13](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1213.22) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Oh, interesting.

[@20:14](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1214.46) \- Courtney  
But it's like a CRM.

[@20:16](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1216.38) \- Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)  
Yeah, so essentially the event would go through there. It would, like, it would have a website, not separate from our users basically log in to their account, and then they register for the event there.  
But you can still see the event page if you're not a, if you're not an account holder.

[@20:40](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1240.1) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Gotcha.

[@20:42](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1242.36) \- Courtney  
The only thing I wonder about is, like, we're doing INN days and NEs and then CJS. So it's just, like, we really have to.

[@20:51](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1251.9) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
People have to buy two tickets. I mean, potentially three. three, yeah, they do, yeah. Like, so we just have to.

[@21:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1260.0) \- Courtney  
To figure out.

[@21:03](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1263.12) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
That was an issue last time that we did this together is that people thought that, not very many, but a couple are like, did I register for that or did I register for that?

[@21:11](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1271.5) \- Courtney  
Right, I remember.

[@21:12](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1272.46) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
I remember screaming that.

[@21:16](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1276.88) \- Courtney  
So I think we want to, how about we meet, could we meet actually sooner than Monday? Like, I think if we could meet Friday, it would be helpful because we could talk, I could debrief you on UNC, because if we're game there, we can just like move.  
If we're not, then we know now and we know, like, I'm reaching out to the others. So if we meet Friday, we could talk.

[@21:45](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1305.96) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
It has to be Friday morning for me, if that's possible, like 10 a.m.

[@21:51](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1311.4) \- Courtney  
Oh, okay.

[@21:52](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1312.64) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Never mind.

[@21:53](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1313.54) \- Courtney  
It'll have to be Monday.

[@21:55](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1315.1) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay, sorry. Just because my sister is in town and.

[@21:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1319.2) \- Courtney  
Then we'll just.

[@22:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1320.0) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
She's only here for two days. But yeah, we can, I'm happy to, in Slack. And then Monday, I'm working on next week, except Thursday and Friday.

[@22:13](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1333.32) \- Courtney  
Okay, I'm out Tuesday through.

[@22:15](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1335.74) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay.

[@22:16](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1336.78) \- Courtney  
What about Thursday?

[@22:19](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1339.88) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
I am slammed Thursday. But we could, no, no, actually, I mean, no, I could join something in the morning.

[@22:28](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1348.2) \- Courtney  
What time?

[@22:31](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1351.22) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Um, like, 10, 30, 11?

[@22:43](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1363.0) \- Courtney  
Um, I think I just might have to work a half-day Tuesday. Let's meet Monday, but we will Slack, and by the time we meet together Monday, we'll all be informed, and we're sort of just making either last-minute decisions or just confirming decisions we make via Slack.  
ACTION ITEM: Reschedule Shamika call to Nov 24 10–10:45; update invite \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1370.9999)  
Okay. Kim, can you update that call with Shamika we have on Monday from 10 to 10.45?

[@23:08](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1388.06) \- Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)  
Mm-hmm.

[@23:09](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1389.14) \- Courtney  
And then that leaves us open between noon and two to meet with you all. Is there a time? Actually, 11, because we could change our call, too.  
So do you have time?

[@23:22](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1402.02) \- Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)  
You don't currently have a call with Shamika on Monday.

[@23:26](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1406.04) \- Courtney  
The IN\&D's touch base?

[@23:29](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1409.16) \- Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)  
Oh, that's at 1.30.

[@23:31](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1411.32) \- Courtney  
Yeah, can you move it to 10 to 10.45?

[@23:33](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1413.6) \- Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)  
talked with her yesterday. Okay. 10 to 10.45. Okay, to 10.45.

[@23:41](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1421.3) \- Courtney  
And then that would free up the day for us to talk to you all between 11 and, really, 11 and 3, because even Scrum, we can skip.

[@23:49](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1429.26) \- Kemuel Farmer (investigativenewsnetwork.org)  
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.-hmm.-hmm.-hmm.-hmm.

[@23:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1439.82) \- Courtney  
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Is there something there that will work for you all between 11 and 3 on Monday the 24th?  
ACTION ITEM: Schedule INN x CCM working session Nov 24 2–3 w/ Courtney/Stefanie/Denise \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1443.9999)

Yeah. I mean, I'm very, very flexible on Monday. One would be perfect.

[@24:14](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1454.2) \- Courtney  
Denise and I already meet at 2\. Okay. We could do that. And let's make that an hour so that we can work through anything.

[@24:24](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1464.02) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Okay. Yeah. Key things to talk about then will be messaging and discuss ticketing too.

[@24:31](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1471.48) \- Courtney  
Yeah. Messaging, registration, and then just like put a period on Vidnew.

[@24:36](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1476.48) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yep. And maybe pitch form too.

[@24:39](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1479.34) \- Courtney  
And pitch form.

[@24:40](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1480.34) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Yeah. Yep. We are still using Eventbrite, but we've been exploring other event registration options because we don't have a full CRM or...  
ARM or AMC or whatever the other thing you've called it was.

[@24:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1499.5) \- Courtney  
AMS.

[@25:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1500.0) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
AMS.

[@25:02](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1502.04) \- Courtney  
Yeah, well, we'll think about it too because it's going to get complicated just in terms of people looking for it.  
Like this site is a little bit more, it's an AMS, so they like, it has its own quirks and kinks and like, yeah, it's easy to like click out to other things.  
And like, so we, we, we'll, we'll just, we'll have to work with it, but I don't think it's impossible.

[@25:31](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1531.94) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)

It's just, it's really about messaging. It is. Yes. Yes. Just clear messaging. And yep. Okay. Okay. That sounds good.  
So we'll talk one day. We will also start thinking about some messaging and we can, I don't mind like just typing out some stuff in Slack too.

[@25:46](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1546.82) \- Courtney  
was like.

[@25:47](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1547.12) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)

[@25:48](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1548.26) \- Courtney  
Yep. Okay. Just like that one liner that we will use or like that set of message points to you to articulate.  
Yeah. We're returning.

[@25:59](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1559.18) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)  
Woo. Woo.

[@26:00](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1560.0) \- Courtney  
We did this before, and it was great. Cool.

[@26:04](https://fathom.video/share/nwTQ_z9XDsEn-_7YksET1TWG1_NvsMTi?timestamp=1564.9) \- Stefanie Murray (mail.montclair.edu)
