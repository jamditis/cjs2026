Hi [First Name],

We're reaching out to a small group — just 13 people who've attended 5 or more Collaborative Journalism Summits since we started in 2017.

You're one of them.

With [X] summits under your belt, you've been there since [earliest_year]. You've seen us grow from 161 people in Montclair to a community of 1,981 unique attendees across 2,569 registrations — practitioners, funders, and journalists who believe collaboration makes journalism stronger.

**This June, we're celebrating 10 years in Pittsburgh** — and we want you there.

As a Super Fan, you'll get:
✨ Early registration access (before public announcement)
✨ VIP recognition at the summit
✨ An invitation to the speakers' dinner
✨ A special "OG" badge for your profile

**[Register now with your VIP code: SUPERFAN10]**

We'd also love your help spreading the word. Would you be willing to:
- Share your favorite CJS memory on social media?
- Invite a colleague who hasn't attended before?
- Join our ambassador Slack channel?

Reply to this email and let us know — we'd love to hear from you.

See you in Pittsburgh,

Stefanie Murray
Director, Center for Cooperative Media

P.S. The 13 Super Fans: [list names]. You're in great company.

## 2. 🎓 Class of 2020 Re-engagement (552 people)

**List:** `class-of-2020.csv`
**Target:** First-time attendees in 2020 who haven't returned
**Goal:** Reconnect them with the in-person experience

### Subject Lines (A/B test)
- A: `Remember CJS 2020? We've missed you.`
- B: `You joined us during the pandemic. Come see what you've been missing.`
- C: `[First Name], time to meet the people behind those Zoom squares`

### Email Body

```
Hi [First Name],

In 2020, you joined 747 people for our first (and hopefully last) virtual Collaborative Journalism Summit. The world was uncertain, newsrooms were scrambling, and somehow, you showed up.

Thank you.

But here's the thing: you've never experienced CJS in person.

You haven't felt the energy of 150 journalists crammed into a room, debating what "collaboration" really means. You haven't had that hallway conversation that turns into a two-year partnership. You haven't stayed up too late at the networking dinner, talking shop with people who actually get it.

**CJS2026 is your chance.**

This June 8-9 in Pittsburgh, we're celebrating 10 years of proving that journalism is stronger together. And we want to finally meet you in person.

**Here's a special offer for pandemic-era first-timers:**
🎟️ Use code **CLASS2020** for $50 off registration
📅 Priority access to the most popular sessions
🤝 Matched networking with other Class of 2020 attendees

**[Claim your spot]**

We've grown a lot since 2020 — from that scrappy virtual gathering to a community of 1,981 people across 6 cities (Pittsburgh will be our 7th!). But the spirit is the same: journalists helping journalists.

Hope to finally shake your hand,

Stefanie Murray
Director, Center for Cooperative Media

P.S. 552 of the 747 people who registered for CJS 2020 haven't been back since. Let's get the band back together.

## 3. 🏆 OG Reunion (161 people)

**List:** `og-attendees-2017.csv`
**Target:** Everyone who attended the inaugural 2017 summit in Montclair
**Goal:** Nostalgia play, celebrating roots

### Subject Lines (A/B test)
- A: `You were there at the beginning. Come celebrate how far we've come.`
- B: `From 161 people in Montclair to 1,981 — you started something`
- C: `[First Name], remember Montclair 2017?`

### Email Body

```
Hi [First Name],

In 2017, 161 of us gathered at Montclair State University with a radical idea: What if competing newsrooms actually worked together?

You were one of those people.

Fast forward 10 years:
- 10 summits
- 6 cities (Pittsburgh will be #7!)
- 2,569 registrations from 1,981 unique individuals
- Countless collaborations launched

And it all started with that first gathering. Your presence helped turn an experiment into a community.

**This June, we're celebrating the 10th anniversary in Pittsburgh** — and we're planning an "OG Reunion" just for the 161 original attendees.

What you'll get:
🏆 Special "OG" recognition at the summit
📸 Group photo of the original crew
🍷 Private reception on Monday evening
🎤 Chance to share your "where were you in 2017" story

**[Claim your OG spot]**

Some of you have been to every summit since. Some haven't been back since that first year. Either way, this is your reunion.

See you where it all began (figuratively — we'll be in Pittsburgh this time),

Stefanie Murray
Director, Center for Cooperative Media

P.S. I've attached a photo from that first summit. Can you spot yourself?

## 4. 😴 Lapsed Attendee Win-back (247 people)

**List:** `lapsed-attendees.csv`
**Target:** Attendees with 2+ summits who haven't returned since 2023
**Goal:** Understand why they left, win them back

### Subject Lines (A/B test)
- A: `We noticed you've been away. Everything okay?`
- B: `[First Name], CJS isn't the same without you`
- C: `A lot has changed since [last_year]. Here's what you're missing.`

### Email Body

```
Hi [First Name],

We were looking through our attendee records and noticed something: you attended [X] summits ([list years]) but haven't been back since [last_year].

We miss you.

And honestly, we're curious — was it something we said? Budget constraints? Life got in the way? Just not relevant anymore?

Whatever the reason, we'd love to hear from you. Reply to this email with a quick note, or just pick one:

👍 I'm still interested, just haven't had the time/budget
👎 CJS isn't really relevant to my work anymore
🤷 I moved on to a different role/industry
💡 I'd come back if [something specific]

**In case you're still interested:**

CJS2026 is our 10th anniversary summit in Pittsburgh (June 8-9). A lot has changed since you last attended:

✨ New tracks on AI in collaborative journalism
✨ More hands-on workshops, fewer panels
✨ Better networking matchmaking
✨ Co-located with INN Days (stay for both!)

**Use code COMEBACK for $75 off registration.**

**[Check out the program]**

Either way, thanks for being part of our journey. You helped build this community, even if you've stepped away for a bit.

Hope to see you again,

Stefanie Murray
Director, Center for Cooperative Media

## 5. 🆕 Recent First-Timer Follow-up (346 people)

**List:** `recent-first-timers.csv`
**Target:** 2024-2025 first-time attendees
**Goal:** Convert one-timers into repeat attendees

### Subject Lines (A/B test)
- A: `Your second CJS could be the 10th anniversary`
- B: `[First Name], ready for round two?`
- C: `The connections you made at CJS[year] — let's keep them going`

### Email Body

```
Hi [First Name],

Last year at CJS[year] in [city], you joined us for the first time.

How was it? We hope it was everything you expected (and maybe a little more chaotic than you anticipated — that's the CJS way).

Here's the thing about CJS: it gets better when you come back.

The first summit, you're figuring out who's who. The second time, you're reconnecting with people, following up on ideas, and going deeper. By your third or fourth summit, you're part of the furniture — leading sessions, introducing people, launching collaborations.

**CJS2026 in Pittsburgh (June 8-9) is your chance to level up.**

What's different this year:
🎉 10th anniversary celebration
📍 Pittsburgh — great food, walkable downtown, affordable
🤝 "Returning Attendee" track with deeper sessions
🔥 Your favorite sessions based on last year's feedback

**Early bird pricing ends March 1 — [register now]**

And if you're on the fence: reach out to someone you met last year. Ask if they're going. There's nothing like showing up and seeing a familiar face.

Looking forward to seeing you again,

Stefanie Murray
Director, Center for Cooperative Media

P.S. If you loved your first CJS experience, bring a colleague! Use code BRINGAFRIEND for $25 off when you register together.

- A: `[First Name], you're 1-2 summits away from Super Fan status`
- B: `3+ summits? You're officially part of the crew.`
- C: `The CJS loyalty program you didn't know existed`

### Email Body

```
Hi [First Name],

With [X] Collaborative Journalism Summits under your belt ([list years]), you're officially in our "Loyal Attendees" club.

Not quite Super Fan status (that's 5+ summits), but you're close. And honestly? You're the backbone of CJS.

Super Fans get the headlines, but loyal attendees like you make the summit work. You're the ones leading sessions, connecting newbies with veterans, and keeping conversations going between events.

**CJS2026 in Pittsburgh is your chance to hit the milestone.**

Here's what loyal attendees get:
⭐ Recognition on our "returning attendees" wall
🎯 First dibs on popular workshop slots
💬 Access to the alumni Slack channel
🏅 Only 1-2 more summits until Super Fan status!

**[Register for CJS2026]**

Thanks for being part of the journey. See you in Pittsburgh?
