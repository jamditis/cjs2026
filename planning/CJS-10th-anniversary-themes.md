## Executive summary

The 2026 Collaborative Journalism Summit marks a decade of bringing together journalists, media leaders, funders, and academics around the practice of working together. This document analyzes the summit's evolution from 2017-2025 to establish a narrative throughline and thematic framework for the 10th anniversary celebration.

**Recommended theme**: "From experiment to ecosystem" — celebrating how collaborative journalism evolved from a novel idea to an established practice over ten years.

**Key insight**: The summit has moved through four distinct phases, each answering a different question:
- 2017-2019: "Can we do this?" (proving the concept)
- 2020-2021: "How do we adapt?" (surviving disruption)
- 2022-2023: "How do we sustain this?" (building infrastructure)
- 2024-2025: "What impact can we achieve?" (demonstrating outcomes)
- 2026: "What's next?" (charting the next decade)

## Art direction: timeline concept

Per the December 2 planning meeting, the approved visual concept is a **timeline of iconic buildings** from each summit city, increasing in size and culminating in a North Carolina landmark.

### Building suggestions by year

| Year | City | Recommended building | Notes |
|------|------|---------------------|-------|
| 2017 | Montclair, NJ | Wellmont Theater | Historic venue, recognizable locally |
| 2018 | Montclair, NJ | MSU campus building | Vary from 2017 for visual interest |
| 2019 | Philadelphia, PA | Independence Hall | "Broke in Philly" connection; historic journalism roots |
| 2020 | Virtual | Laptop/screen | COVID pivot — "the bump in the road" |
| 2021 | Virtual | House with WiFi icon | Working from home era |
| 2022 | Chicago, IL | Willis (Sears) Tower | City Bureau, Solving for Chicago |
| 2023 | Washington, D.C. | Capitol Building | Policy focus, democracy journalism |
| 2024 | Detroit, MI | Renaissance Center | Motor City revival theme |
| 2025 | Denver, CO | Union Station | Colorado as "collaboration laboratory" |
| 2026 | Chapel Hill, NC | Old Well (UNC) | Research Triangle, culminating landmark |

### Visual progression guidelines

- Buildings should increase in size along the timeline

- COVID years (2020-2021) represented by laptop/screen to show disruption
- Color palette: transition to Carolina blue (#7BAFD4) for NC portion
- Consider Duke blue (#001A57) as accent
- Timeline tells a story: small beginnings → disruption → growth → culmination

### Alternative NC landmarks

- NC State Capitol (Raleigh)
- Duke Chapel
- Morehead Planetarium (UNC)
- Research Triangle Park signage
