## Meeting Purpose

[Finalize CJS 2026 art, announcements, and session structure.](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?tab=summary&timestamp=1733.0)

## Key Takeaways

* [Art Direction Finalized: The 10th-anniversary art will be a "timeline" of iconic buildings from past summit cities, leading to a prominent North Carolina landmark. This concept is more practical for print and clearly communicates the anniversary.](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?tab=summary&timestamp=1337.0)  
* [Session Structure Shift: The team will likely move to an invitation-only model for sessions. This avoids the high pitch volume (80 last year) for a limited number of slots (est. 6\) and ensures curated, high-quality content.](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?tab=summary&timestamp=1068.0)  
* [Announcement Plan: A basic Save the Date graphic will be created for a co-announcement with INN this Thursday. The full art and pitch form will follow once the session structure is confirmed.](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?tab=summary&timestamp=1759.0)  
* [New Ideas: Two new concepts were proposed: a "CJS Bingo" icebreaker game and incorporating safety trainings from the International Women's Media Foundation (IWMF).](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?tab=summary&timestamp=1841.0)

## Topics

### CJS 2026 Art Direction

* [Initial Concepts: Joe presented several concepts, including a "knolling" (deconstructed visual) of North Carolina iconography and a "game board" of isometric city tiles.](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?tab=summary&timestamp=213.0)

# TRANSCRIPT: CJS 2026\! \- December 02

[VIEW RECORDING \- 42 mins (No highlights)](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL)

[@0:02](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2.18) \- Amy Maestas  
I'm in from kindergarten to the kindergarten class today.

[@0:05](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=5.28) \- Joe Amditis  
That's right. Yeah, no, I was, the Mac has such better backgrounds. Like, it blends in so much nicer than, and these are just like the standard ones.  
This isn't Zoom. This is like, now I'm all boring in my house, and now I'm engaging. Changing? Funny, funny.

[@0:28](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=28.5) \- Denise Shannon  
I didn't say anything changed, but okay.

[@0:30](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=30.94) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh, you guys don't see the, like, lighting change at all when I go like. Yeah, let me see. Yeah, I see the lighting change.

[@0:36](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=36.64) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah, it's subtle.

[@0:37](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=37.82) \- Denise Shannon  
Lightly.

[@0:38](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=38.94) \- Joe Amditis  
I'm in an orange liminal space. You know, it's funny. Last week when we were, hey, William. Hey, Mr. Jeff.  
How you feeling, brother? No, we're going to talk to him later. He's working right now. He's been talking about you since he woke up for some reason.  
Oh, I've been thinking about him. He is what? You know when Oney was saying he was in the waiting room and he couldn't get in and I.  
I didn't see the waiting room and everything when I was in the car. It's because I was logged in as Montclair, so I couldn't even see the waiting room.  
I wasn't the host, so he may well have been in the waiting room, and now he just thinks his Zoom is broken or something.  
So we just kept sending, like, Oni, here's the link, Oni, it's there. And he's probably just like, and I felt like he was so distraught about that.  
It feels so bad because as soon as we hung up, I was like, wait a minute, that's not the profile picture for the center's account.  
I was like, and I looked, and when I joined again, I joined back, and it just said user, not host.  
And I was like, oh, my God, we just were collectively gaslighting him for, like, an hour. He, like, filed the ticket and escalated it to IT and everything, and we just like, yeah, man, I don't know what's wrong with your computer.  
Aw, I feel so bad. Aw, poor Oni. Okay, so I just want to set your expectations very low for the art, quote, unquote.  
That I have. These are all concept things. And as Stefanie saw, I was drawing a lighthouse with my Apple Pencil, just putting some final touches on it.  
So at first I was not sure what you were drawing, to be honest with you. I was. It was nothing weird.  
It was, it was, it's a lighthouse. turned out. Okay. What is this? And then I realized. There are lighthouses in North Carolina.  
was a little phallic looking. Lighthouses be like that. Yeah. Okay. So I have to go, I'm going to get William dressed.  
So I can only be here for a couple of minutes, but yeah, I was hoping that we could, that you guys can make as much progress as you can in talking through the art and the, would you be able to get him dressed real quick?  
So, and then save the date website and pitch form. The whole thing. Yep. So do you want to show us what you have real quick?  
I don't want to, but I'm going to. Okay. I mean, it can be rough. That's fine. Okay. So actually, let me pull up this other one real quick, and then I'll share.  
My Mac updated and the corner radiuses or radii or whatever on these damn windows are so... You probably don't want Joe to...  
You probably don't want David to come look at your designs yet, right? I don't even want him to know about them yet.  
Stay away, man. Get away. $500, babe. We could be rich. This is free . So I learned recently, I learned a new word.  
It's called knolling, K-N-O-L-L-I-N-G. And so a knolling is essentially like a deconstruction of a concept in visual format. So a knolling of, you know, a phone would be all of its parts laid out on a table.  
knolling of a knolling. So You know, in a deconstructed sort of exploded way. And so what I wanted to do, it turns out that like the 10th anniversary graphic that Michael Holler made for us is technically what could be counted as a knolling for New Jersey.  
And so I was, I want to do, I started there and I wanted to sort of, you know, do what we usually do, which is when we go to a new city, we identify some of the iconography and paraphernalia associated with, you know, that state or that city.  
And because we're in the RDU area, the triangle, as they call it, the research triangle, the triangle, they call it the beltway.  
got a couple of different thoughts and ideas about the type of imagery. Obviously, one of them is a, you know, the classic, like North Carolina has a lot of really cool water towers, really historic water towers.  
And they also have some iconic lighthouses. And they also, because we're in RDU, like I was saying, there's like the historic like tobacco trade.  
Is one of the things that is in Durham, for example. And so some of that is essentially, that's the kind of imagery I was going for.  
And then I'm going to show you in a minute. I know you can't see this yet. And then the other thing is, I thought it would be cool for the 10th anniversary aspect to sort of go through all the other cities we've visited and bring in like little miniature isometric, like tiles of each city sort of leading to, you know, North Carolina as the most recent one.  
So I got a bunch of different concepts here. None of these, I'm going to, I'm not going to use any of these.  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=340.17037)  
I'm going to, you know, make them my own. Essentially, oh my God, what? Hold on. Let me, does it, okay.  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=348.980765)  
It doesn't show the zoom windows. Good. Okay. So let me get these out of my way. Including this stupid floating thing.  
I had a video pan. There we go. So. Each one of these. So this is Raleigh. This is Durham.  
This is Raleigh. And this is Chapel Hill. These three here, they're little isometric, little mini towns of things. Let get this out of the way.  
Sorry. There we go. And then these are ones from each of the other cities we visited. So let me just move all this stuff up so you can see.  
So we've got Chicago. We've got D.C. We've got, I believe this is, this is, which one is this? I don't know.

[@6:29](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=389.92) \- Denise Shannon  
That's probably Chicago because you have the ballpark.

[@6:32](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=392.9) \- Joe Amditis  
This is Chicago for sure. This is Detroit. This is D.C.

[@6:37](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=397.78) \- Denise Shannon  
This is Philly.

[@6:39](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=399.42) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh my God. This is Philly. And this is Montclair. This is Montclair. And then this is, where else? Denver.  
I don't know why that's supposed to be Denver.

[@6:48](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=408.56) \- Denise Shannon  
Oh, Denver.

[@6:49](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=409.5) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. So I made them all sort of like grayed out. I don't know how I'm going to arrange these yet, but I was thinking something like this.  
So we might just kind of get rid of the Durham and the, uh, uh, The Chapel Hill one, although we are going to be at UNC, so maybe we keep the Chapel Hill one, but I don't know where I'm going with this yet.  
This is just sort of like a thought I had. I think it might actually work better horizontally and then have this one sort of like large, you know, in the middle here.  
But there's a little disjointed, and if they're not like linked together, it doesn't really play. So I'm sort of souring on that one.  
Then we have like a little, you know, like I said, water tower sketch here. Here's the lighthouse. Okay. And then this is a knolling of North Carolina stuff.  
Problem with this is almost every one of these is in the wrong place. So I would obviously have to move these around.  
Lighthouses and beach stuff over here. But North Carolina is generally divided into four regions. There's the coastal plains. There's the Piedmont.  
There's the can't remember the third one. And then there's the mountainous areas in the west. So we're not going to be – obviously we're going to be focusing on  
the coastal plains, which is like right here, or sorry, the Piedmont, which is right here where Raleigh is and everything.  
But I did want to make sure that we're sort of like a nod at least to the rest of the state because just because we're in the capital doesn't mean it's not a North Carolina focused.  
So that's kind of where I'm going. We're obviously going to be at UNC, so we'll probably leave some of the Duke and the NC State stuff out.  
Well, probably I'm thinking obviously we're going to lean into the Carolina blue, that like Tar Heel blue, and we can use the Duke blue as a sort of accent.  
We went with a lot of green and orange last year in Denver, so this one is appropriate to go with that blue, white, and dark blue color palette there.  
I've just been throwing everything I can at the, you know, the thing here. This is a version that is obviously more news and information journalism oriented.  
So we got WRAL, News and Observer, a mess, obviously. Most of this doesn't make any sense, but these little types of iconography is what I'm saying.  
So I'm feeling more of the, I'm not, the knolling, I get it, that might be useful for like a poster sort of thing.  
Sure, because we can break out each one of these and use them as iconography. I am feeling though something with the shape of North Carolina, with some two pieces of iconography.  
We also need to get something that says 10th Anniversary Collaborative Journalism Summit on that spec too. Yes, yeah, I wasn't, I wasn't, I was.  
No, I know you're early. That's just what I, so I do like the idea of the knolling concept though for a poster.  
Because remember Amy, you know, had that excellent example from the PMG. NFCB, yeah. Yeah, yeah. The Community Broadcasting Conference.

[@9:56](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=596.64) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah.

[@9:57](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=597.64) \- Joe Amditis  
Like the, like the poster, Joe, like the. I think would be really cool for the 10th anniversary. But I would also, look at Amy.  
Was that Amy? Wait, in that photo? Scroll down. Oh, my God.  
ACTION ITEM: Resend PMG/NFCB conference poster example to Joe via Slack \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=612.9999)

[@10:13](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=613.561) \- Amy Maestas  
I haven't seen that photo. Oh, yeah, it was when I helped them with their conference.

[@10:16](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=616.881) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. Oh, . So, I'm also a like. Did you see that in Slack, Amy? I don't remember seeing that.  
I must have missed that. Missed what? The conference poster you sent? don't remember. Oh, it was a while ago.

[@10:33](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=633.321) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah, was.

[@10:34](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=634.081) \- Joe Amditis  
It's been a couple months ago. I'll send it again. Okay, that would be great. something like that, Joe, think would be really good.  
But I also don't know if the conference, like, so I love the idea that Amy brought up of a conference poster, I guess is what I'm saying.  
Second, though, I don't know if our conference poster for this year should be just North Carolina or should be 10th anniversary, some sort of, like, really interesting collection.  
Well, that's sort of what I was leaning towards with the different tiles of this. It is, but... have have to...  
to... Go, but you guys can keep talking. Awesome. Thank you for, I hate all your ideas. I like that other idea.

[@11:05](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=665.341) \- Denise Shannon  
got to go. See you later. Bye.

[@11:08](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=668.681) \- Joe Amditis  
Get David over here. God damn it. That's how it usually goes anyway. No, but so I picked up on that as well.  
I think I'm still, this is early days. I was planning, I wanted to do, I was really just doing field recon while I was in North Carolina.  
went out to Pittsburgh. I went out to Durham. I went to Bear Creek. I went to the boonies, you know, shot some guns.  
I was really getting in character doing some, some, you know, deep ethnography. And I definitely want to lean like half tour, half and half.  
You're like, we want to represent North Carolina, but we want to, you know, lean into the 10th anniversary elements as well.  
And so I kind of was going for that with the little city tiles, the sort of like game board thing.  
I was thinking a little bit of like Settlers of Catan or Catan.

[@11:51](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=711.641) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, it does have, yeah, it definitely had that feel.

[@11:54](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=714.061) \- Joe Amditis  
I might go with hexagons, obviously, to make it a little easier to wedge them together. But yeah, I mean, it's tough to say it's it's kind of a tough design task to do 10 years of collaborative journalism and also North Carolina.  
So, I mean, as the sort of crown culminating jewel. And then also the two of those years we were locked in our rooms, you know, doing it virtually.  
So I wanted to include a nod to that. I was still sort of coming up with a way to indicate that just like a little a little like, you know, bump in the road there where we're all behind a screen.

[@12:25](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=745.241) \- Amy Maestas  
Right.

[@12:26](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=746.021) \- Denise Shannon  
I think you have to think of them as two different, you know, two separate concepts.

[@12:30](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=750.701) \- Amy Maestas  
We're going to have the 10th anniversary poster.

[@12:35](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=755.801) \- Denise Shannon  
Got it. And then we're going to have all of the North Carolina, you know, we're going to have a lot of Charlotte represented.  
So that's got to be it. Well, hello there.

[@12:46](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=766.141) \- Joe Amditis  
That is going crazy.

[@12:47](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=767.461) \- Denise Shannon  
Yep. So, you know, and how that's going to translate to print for everything else, you know, that we're doing during the conference, there really are.  
I don't think you can possibly mash it.

[@13:00](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=780.001) \- Joe Amditis  
I think for the first round of promo or like announcement graphics, we can just do something. I mean, the designs have evolved every year.  
You know, we start with something really basic.

[@13:11](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=791.661) \- Denise Shannon  
I usually throw something together in candle with like a gradient background that says impact or whatever, you know, something stupid like that.

[@13:17](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=797.721) \- Joe Amditis  
And then as we get closer, as we get a better sense of the schedule and the, you know, the attendees.  
But I think for this one, we can lean into the 10th anniversary start and have like a little, you know, New, I keep calling it New Jersey, North Carolina, like badge or something or corner that says, you know, we're going to the, what do they call it?  
They're not the Freedom State. That's New Hampshire. What is North Carolina State?

[@13:42](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=822.921) \- Denise Shannon  
no idea.

[@13:44](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=824.621) \- Joe Amditis  
They are the first in flight, but now they changed their thing that is to be first in freedom, which is really on their license plates.  
Um, is that, is that historically accurate?

[@13:57](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=837.881) \- Denise Shannon  
I don't think so. I'm not thinking it.

[@14:01](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=841.082) \- Joe Amditis  
Of course, they're the Tar Heel State. I don't know what's wrong with me. But yeah, I think that's a bit gratuitous there.

[@14:08](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=848.702) \- Denise Shannon  
For sure. Yeah, I mean, we're hoping to be able to do the Save the Date announcement in conjunction with INN.  
ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ Friday Center (UNC) re: venue proposal \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=852.9999)  
So it should be pretty basic in terms of what we're putting out. I don't. I'm going to follow up with the Friday Center today because I haven't heard anything since last week and I emailed her yesterday.  
We obviously can't announce until I have some kind of proposal in hand. You know, that's just to protect ourselves.

[@14:42](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=882.322) \- Joe Amditis  
Apparently, the Raleigh Convention Center was on fire last night.

[@14:46](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=886.402) \- Denise Shannon  
Well, glad we're not there.

[@14:49](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=889.342) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. So that's, yeah.

[@14:53](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=893.502) \- Denise Shannon  
But yeah, I mean, we definitely want to have something ready to go for that and the pitch forum. Which, I mean, we're basically going to duplicate it since we're doing...  
Yeah.

[@15:05](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=905.962) \- Joe Amditis  
I thought the pitch form is done, right?

[@15:08](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=908.602) \- Denise Shannon  
I'll go back and look at what's on the air table.

[@15:11](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=911.762) \- Joe Amditis  
I thought I put that together already. think we, last time we had talked, we had said, let me hear, here we go.  
Pitches, let's see, forms, pitch or request a session at the 2026... Oh, I'm not sharing anymore. Hold on.  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=928.078302)

[@15:30](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=930.002) \- Denise Shannon  
I think, is it June 8th and 9th or is it, is it, yes, 19th. Okay, it is. Yeah, it's 8th and 9th.

[@15:35](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=935.422) \- Joe Amditis  
So, yeah, I think, I think this is done.

[@15:41](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=941.102) \- Denise Shannon  
Okay. So, we just have to, we probably have to change the kind of session that they're pitching, because we really are only going to do, we're going to do keynotes, possibly a panel.  
On day one, and the lightning talks, and then day two is going to be all workshops, I believe.

[@16:14](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=974.342) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, and remember we had said something like... more interactive. Yeah, we said something like we were going to basically, it was going to be much more rigid, like we're basically going to, did we agree that we're going to do like, do you want to do this session, this, like we have the available sessions, they can pick a slot.

[@16:30](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=990.002) \- Denise Shannon  
Kind of thing, is that what we're doing, or no, do we lean away from that? I think we went back to accepting pitches, but it should probably be clear somewhere that the format is going to be, so we're not getting 80 people, you know, 80 pitches like we did last year, when really there's only like, you know, a half dozen slots.  
to 80 people. So And And then and Day two, and that's being super generous.

[@17:08](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1028.2) \- Amy Maestas  
How many slots are there for pitched sessions?

[@17:14](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1034.66) \- Denise Shannon  
That's what I was trying to get at with Stefanie's idea of keynotes and lightning talks being on day one, potentially two keynotes and only lightning talks, and then workshops.  
I mean, I think being very generous, six, but I don't know that that really can accommodate that many, depending on how interactive.

[@17:48](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1068.64) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah, I mean, my two cents on that, given that there's so few slots for those sessions, is what if we...  
We get a whole bunch of pitches and none of them is really in the vein of what we want to do, particularly for the 10th year, if there's any sort of theme or something like that.  
And I think that we could so easily, and this is late to the game to decide this, but I think so easily, if there are six slots, we could so easily come up with sessions and invite people to do them.  
Like you said, had 80 pitches last year. Imagine if we get 80 this year, we only have six slots to fill, but we get a bunch of duds.  
ACTION ITEM: Revisit pitch-form strategy w/ Stefanie; decide open vs invite; update Airtable; set 10-min lightning \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1129.9999)

[@18:40](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1120.72) \- Denise Shannon  
Not to say they're duds, but, you know. No, I agree 100% about that. Thank you. Yeah, I'd say I'll put that on our list to revisit with Stefanie.  
Because we're probably not going to release the pitch form until next week. We'd get to save the date and maybe we just, it's more of invitation, as you said.

[@19:19](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1159.22) \- Amy Maestas  
Because we had talked about that initially. Yeah, that's fine.

[@19:23](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1163.24) \- Denise Shannon  
If we're already having conversations with people in Charlotte, you know, they're going to feel... They're going to feel slots.

[@19:36](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1176.02) \- Joe Amditis  
Where the is this color? There it is.

[@19:41](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1181.9) \- Amy Maestas  
Am I going crazy? That's the North Carolina blue, Liza, I think.

[@19:46](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1186.48) \- Liza Gross  
And it will force Joe into all kinds of choices that, you know, because obviously we can't do strong colors with that thing there.

[@19:58](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1198.32) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. it's... What was... I would say before is, like, I'm trying to figure out the direction to go. Like, are we going to do – and I can change this to say, you know, collaborative journalism or CJS 2026\.  
ACTION ITEM: Produce basic Save the Date graphic for INN co-announcement \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1214.9999)  
The problem with the North Carolina state ally, number one, it's a massive state. Number two, it's, like, long. So anything – it's a very long boy here.  
So this is going be a little tough. I'm going to have to play around with this a little more.  
I'll have something – I'll put together something that is, you know, really basic and easy. for us to work with for the announcement, and then we'll continue to refine it a little bit.

[@20:36](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1236.22) \- Liza Gross  
These two – Have you been able to introduce the 10 theme somewhere there, Joe?

[@20:41](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1241.0) \- Joe Amditis  
Say again?

[@20:41](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1241.76) \- Liza Gross  
Have you been able to introduce the 10 theme?

[@20:44](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1244.84) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah. So earlier I was going through – so basically each one of these little city blocks are representing to the cities that we've done before in the past.  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1245.681456)  
So we've got Chicago, we've got – We've D.C., we've got Detroit, we've got Denver, we've got Philly, and we've got Montclair.  
I'd probably move this one over here and put Montclair in the middle here. But I was kind of trying to do it like a progression thing.  
And then each of this is Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill. is Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, which is known as the triangle. They refer to them as RDU, as like sort of a single unit.  
Right. So I thought that could be a fun little thing there. I don't want to make it too niche so that only people from North Carolina, you know, recognize it.  
But I do want to make it at least, you know, so that the locals understand that we took some time to pay attention to their culture and their history.  
This could be cool. I don't know. So that's sort of where I'm at. This is early stages. I really wanted to get some –  
Design work done while I was on vacation in North Carolina for the holiday, but it turns out that when you are surrounded by family at Thanksgiving, they want to, like, talk to you and stuff and, like, visit with you, so it's very annoying.

[@22:17](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1337.36) \- Liza Gross  
How about taking a distinctive, a landmark building on ETH from each of these spots and doing, like, a timeline that covers ETH?

[@22:26](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1346.68) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Like, there's a building from each of those cities that you could build, like, this fake city, but with these, you know, an icon from each of those.

[@22:39](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1359.56) \- Joe Amditis  
That's a great idea.

[@22:40](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1360.88) \- Denise Shannon  
Instead of doing a B-2 bomber here, a stealth bomber, like I assume. Right, and that's going to translate better to print.

[@22:48](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1368.78) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, well, these details are going to be a nightmare.

[@22:52](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1372.96) \- Liza Gross  
Yeah, that has too many elements. mean, really, it would have to be either very big or or Yeah. Quality of the image is going to be not that great.  
But just taking one building and doing sort of a yellow brick road.

[@23:16](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1396.38) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, a to CJS. That's right.

[@23:19](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1399.48) \- Liza Gross  
Many roads. Yes. All roads lead to CJS.

[@23:23](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1403.76) \- Denise Shannon  
I feel like the train is coming back.

[@23:26](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1406.2) \- Joe Amditis  
We're going to get on the train.

[@23:28](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1408.02) \- Denise Shannon  
I'm always going to be vying for the train.

[@23:32](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1412.4) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, I like that. The timeline, like the little, like, you know, we could have, you know, this one would be, or whatever.  
Let's imagine that this is the end of the timeline in North Carolina. Then we have, like, the Sears Tower or whatever for Chicago.  
We have the, what's it called, buildings, the GM buildings for Detroit. Right. Kind of a thing. And we isolate them, obviously.  
We have a good idea. DC is obviously the... The Capitol Building and stuff. Where the hell is D.C.? This one.

[@24:04](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1444.8) \- Liza Gross  
Oh, maybe the East Wing.

[@24:06](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1446.98) \- Joe Amditis  
All of them, exactly.

[@24:09](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1449.54) \- Amy Maestas  
How about the Rose Garden?

[@24:11](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1451.16) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh, never mind.

[@24:12](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1452.38) \- Denise Shannon  
Never mind, it's gone.

[@24:13](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1453.56) \- Joe Amditis  
In the Rose Parking Lab. Yeah, so it sounds like we're all kind of in the same headspace.

[@24:22](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1462.88) \- Liza Gross  
I just have to make it a reality. That's the fun and the tough part. Yeah, and you maybe can use like a diagonal perspective of making the, you know, the older ones smaller until you get to North Carolina and make that bigger.  
Yep. You know, a progression in size and the year right next to it. Now, what do we do for COVID, though?

[@24:46](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1486.9) \- Joe Amditis  
Online? Yeah, we talked about that. was going to do like a laptop or something.

[@24:52](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1492.48) \- Liza Gross  
Yeah, that's great.

[@24:53](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1493.56) \- Joe Amditis  
I love it. Yeah, so, so.

[@24:57](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1497.06) \- Amy Maestas  
The Zoom logo.

[@24:58](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1498.84) \- Denise Shannon  
Pretty much.

[@25:01](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1501.62) \- Liza Gross  
Yeah, and then Zoom comes after us for utilizing our logo without permission.

[@25:07](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1507.94) \- Denise Shannon  
That too.

[@25:09](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1509.62) \- Joe Amditis  
So yeah, I have my directions in that department. I don't want to take up too much more of the time.  
Like I said, I'll have something, at least something basic, even if it's just like a UNC, you know, Tar Heel Blue CJS logo.

[@25:24](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1524.86) \- Liza Gross  
But why should you have all the fun?

[@25:26](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1526.38) \- Joe Amditis  
This is fun. I'm down. I'm down to have the whole meeting about this, but I want to make sure that we're not, I'm not Monopoly.

[@25:32](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1532.56) \- Liza Gross  
I know, I know, I know. We have, we have things to do, things to work out, decisions to make.

[@25:38](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1538.0) \- Joe Amditis  
But I think the pitch, I think the pitch form is effectively, you know, ready for, let's say, let's call it ready for final review.  
Once we did, like what you said, once we decide whether or not we want to do, lock them into the hard, you know, areas or not.  
Like the hard slots, or if we want to give them more, you know, leeway, but, and yeah, like. You said we'll have to switch up the times because right now it says Monday or Tuesday afternoon.  
Is it Monday or Tuesday?

[@26:06](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1566.78) \- Denise Shannon  
Wait, is that actually?

[@26:07](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1567.88) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh, it is.

[@26:10](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1570.68) \- Denise Shannon  
Yeah, Monday will be an afternoon start time. Stephanie's envisioning a keynote, lightning talks, the dinner, and at the dinner we'd also have a speaker or panel.

[@26:31](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1591.96) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah.

[@26:33](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1593.68) \- Denise Shannon  
And then workshops all day on Tuesday.

[@26:42](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1602.68) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay.

[@26:45](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1605.94) \- Denise Shannon  
I love the idea of 10 iconic buildings, though.  
ACTION ITEM: Draft 10-year theme/narrative w/ Stefanie \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1606.9999)

[@26:49](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1609.9) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, think that's a great direction to go in.

[@26:53](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1613.12) \- Denise Shannon  
Absolutely. up the 10 concept everywhere.

[@26:57](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1617.16) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, I'm going to need Stephanie to... Work with me on a, you know, 10 years of collaborative journalism or a, you know, the state of collaboration over the last 10 years kind of a thing.

[@27:12](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1632.92) \- Liza Gross  
I thought what was unforgettable was the rap. As background music.

[@27:20](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1640.42) \- Joe Amditis  
The rap?

[@27:21](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1641.28) \- Denise Shannon  
Oh, that was amazing. That was just, I don't know what, can we do it again? You did that in Philly, right?  
I did. No, you did it after.

[@27:28](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1648.84) \- Joe Amditis  
Like three years. pulled a lot. Yeah, did. I did that for like three years. And then I kind of, I didn't get sick of it, but I kind of exhausted my musical.  
And that was honestly, that was so much fun. But it did stress me the hell out. And unfortunately, actually, no, I do technically have the videos.  
I was technically able to recover the videos from last year, but the audio is trash. So maybe I can work with something.  
Maybe I'll take a look. Got it. But, yeah. Yeah, I did that on BandLab. That was before AI music and everything.

[@28:12](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1692.0) \- Liza Gross  
But, you know, maybe you can think to another, can switch to another musical genre, like a merengue type thing or something like that.  
A little bit livelier. Or disco.

[@28:21](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1701.98) \- Joe Amditis  
Like collaborative bachata.

[@28:24](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1704.2) \- Liza Gross  
That's right. I love it.

[@28:26](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1706.26) \- Joe Amditis  
Collaborative bachata. I love it. There you go. Right now, I'm just collecting screenshots of every Giving Tuesday email that I've, that in my inbox for our, for our post about giving, giving Newsday.  
But.

[@28:45](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1725.52) \- Denise Shannon  
All right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna hop off. Okay. On some calls.

[@28:53](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1733.72) \- Liza Gross  
What else do we need to resolve? I know that. Stephanie left. Stephanie A list that she was hoping, a list, but two or three, I'm trying to find it in Slack, or two things that she hoped would be resolved in the conversation, even though she had to leave early.

[@29:13](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1753.84) \- Amy Maestas  
I mean, the art and the announcement were the big things, right?

[@29:18](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1758.0) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah.

[@29:19](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1759.32) \- Liza Gross  
Talk about the 10th anniversary art and getting the save a date, pitch form, and website ready for announcing on Thursday.

[@29:27](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1767.14) \- Joe Amditis  
Yep, that's pretty much it.

[@29:28](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1768.62) \- Liza Gross  
This Thursday?

[@29:30](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1770.62) \- Joe Amditis  
Well, we're going to be meeting with INN.

[@29:33](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1773.2) \- Liza Gross  
Ah.

[@29:34](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1774.1) \- Joe Amditis  
So we want to have something ready to show them, and I think they're announcing Thursday, right? Am I correct about that?  
I think they're announcing Thursday, so we want to co-announce.

[@29:43](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1783.92) \- Amy Maestas  
The impression I got. But I think, I mean, we can drop this in Slack about what we just talked about of whether to do pitch form, you know, to take pitches, since there are so, so few spots for those.

[@29:56](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1796.38) \- Joe Amditis  
Right.

[@29:57](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1797.38) \- Amy Maestas  
I mean, we'd have, you know.

[@29:58](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1798.74) \- Liza Gross  
know. Thank you. But also remember, if we're going to do the 10 minutes or the play with a 10, we need to put that requirement in.

[@30:06](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1806.44) \- Joe Amditis  
Otherwise, we're going to get pitches that are within Yeah, so I think that's also the thing we really need to hammer down and lock down is the slots that we're offering.  
Because right now, it just says, like, lightning talk, main session. I think we need to just be a little bit more specific about that, and then we'll be good to go.  
But that's something that we can change, you know, in a second. We can build everything else around it and just make sure that the structure is there.  
And that way, as long as the bones are good, we are.

[@30:41](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1841.4) \- Liza Gross  
Amy, did you have already a chance to mention to Joe and Denise the conversation with Elisa yesterday?

[@30:51](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1851.08) \- Amy Maestas  
No, I have not.

[@30:52](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1852.02) \- Liza Gross  
Oh, okay. IWMF is doing these trainings, these safety trainings, Joe. And we were talking about how to incorporate. Now, last year, they did them within the INN days.  
So they were part of the program. And they may do that as well. But they were also thinking of having some presence in the collaboratives.  
So in our summit. So just to put it in the hopper in terms of it's a pretty complete training that they do cybersecurity, but they also do physical training and for ethnic media reporters and for and now that the elections are coming and we're likely to see, you know, some heated arguments over things or I think it could be pretty, pretty useful.

[@31:44](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1904.36) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay.

[@31:45](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1905.22) \- Liza Gross  
So just, you know, just throw it in the hopper with the topics or.

[@31:48](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1908.58) \- Joe Amditis  
As a Minecraft player, I love that you're calling it a hopper. That's awesome.

[@31:53](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1913.58) \- Liza Gross  
Oh, okay.

[@31:56](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1916.14) \- Amy Maestas  
That's very much it.

[@31:57](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1917.3) \- Joe Amditis  
That's a newsroom term. Is it really?

[@32:00](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1920.0) \- Amy Maestas  
I mean, not that invented, but it's used in the newsroom as in put an idea in a list for a story idea or something like that.

[@32:07](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1927.36) \- Joe Amditis  
And then it drops into place when it's its turn. Yeah. In Minecraft, that is that's how you transfer items from a smelter or a chest into your into another chest.

[@32:17](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1937.8) \- Liza Gross  
Oh, got it.

[@32:18](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1938.92) \- Amy Maestas  
OK. I didn't know that there was.

[@32:21](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1941.72) \- Joe Amditis  
Yeah, I didn't know that there was a mining.

[@32:23](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1943.5) \- Liza Gross  
I didn't know that either.

[@32:25](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1945.34) \- Joe Amditis  
Drop the coal down into the chute. The hopper is what carries it and like a funnel and puts it into the next chest.

[@32:31](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1951.52) \- Liza Gross  
So that's pretty fun. That makes sense. It's the same function.

[@32:35](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1955.94) \- Joe Amditis  
An actual mining term, but I'm not a miner.

[@32:38](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1958.72) \- Liza Gross  
I'm a minecrafter. So that's what I associate. I bet you it comes from that. You know, the figure of speech comes from somewhere where ideas or places or things are collected.  
ACTION ITEM: Post meeting bullets in Slack for Stefanie \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1970.9999)

[@32:51](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1971.88) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah, I'm going to look that up.

[@32:53](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1973.46) \- Joe Amditis  
That's where you're probably right. That's really cool. It's such a perfect term.

[@32:56](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1976.94) \- Amy Maestas  
It really is. Yeah.

[@32:59](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1979.46) \- Joe Amditis  
Awesome. Okay. So yeah, so let's type some of this up in like bullet points or whatever into Slack. And then that way, Stefanie will be able to take a look when she gets back from the hospital or the doctor or whatever she ends up unfortunately having to deal with today.  
Is anybody else like getting clearly getting some kind of cold or something?

[@33:19](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=1999.9) \- Liza Gross  
Oh yeah, me. I've been struggling. Yeah. I had to cancel my Thanksgiving dinner because I didn't want to bring germs to my friends and the other guests.

[@33:30](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2010.12) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh, that sucks.

[@33:31](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2011.36) \- Liza Gross  
Yeah.

[@33:31](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2011.92) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah. Well, I've been, I've been, I've had a stomach thing for two days, but I don't have a cold, but I, I did get my flu vaccine and COVID vaccine yesterday, so I cannot lift my arms today.

[@33:46](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2026.78) \- Liza Gross  
Yeah.

[@33:47](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2027.8) \- Joe Amditis  
Double, double, guns.

[@33:49](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2029.36) \- Amy Maestas  
Did you do both? Did you do one in each arm? One in each arm, yeah.

[@33:53](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2033.68) \- Liza Gross  
Yeah.

[@33:54](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2034.12) \- Amy Maestas  
See?

[@33:55](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2035.14) \- Liza Gross  
Secretary Kennedy is right. Vaccines are bad.

[@34:00](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2040.0) \- Amy Maestas  
And I did a new and very hard bar class at the gym yesterday morning.

[@34:06](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2046.26) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh, Jesus.

[@34:07](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2047.46) \- Amy Maestas  
So I'm really, I'm armless today.

[@34:10](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2050.9) \- Joe Amditis  
So I might have to do my work via dictation. Honestly, I am obsessed with using the speech to text features on the computer to type.  
And it feels like you're yelling at Jarvis. Jarvis, do this. And you're talking on the, and it's typing for you.  
Google Docs has a built-in speech to text thing.

[@34:30](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2070.38) \- Amy Maestas  
I don't know if you guys knew this, but if you press. Yeah, I try to get my dad. I've tried over the, over the last couple of years to get him to have used it so that he can tell stories.

[@34:40](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2080.02) \- Joe Amditis  
Cause he can't.

[@34:41](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2081.08) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah. And he can't. And he likes to see the words on the screen as opposed to just like a voice recorder.  
But he never, he was never able to understand the.

[@34:54](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2094.12) \- Joe Amditis  
I tried to get my dad to do the exact same thing this weekend. Or last weekend.

[@34:58](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2098.58) \- Amy Maestas  
Yeah.

[@34:59](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2099.14) \- Joe Amditis  
he kept one. Running to type. And he sucks at typing, which is the funniest. He's a 40-year veteran computer programmer, software engineer, and is the worst typist I've ever seen for that skill level.

[@35:11](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2111.08) \- Liza Gross  
You know, I am still amazed that your dad talks to you after that prank you played on him. He should have disinherited you and thrown you out of the window.

[@35:19](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2119.57) \- Joe Amditis  
Won't shut up about it. And yet he didn't learn any of the lessons because the other day he thought...

[@35:24](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2124.15) \- Liza Gross  
So you'll have to do it again.

[@35:26](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2126.57) \- Joe Amditis  
The other day, he was driving. supposed to be coming over to hang out before we went to dinner to my mom's place.  
And he's like, oh, I just got sideswiped by this girl in traffic or whatever. And proceeds to tell me that he didn't collect her information.  
He let her go with a lecture. And I'm like, did you not learn your lesson about lecturing people, random people?  
Do we have to prank you again? Do we have to do another? He will never learn.

[@35:52](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2152.69) \- Liza Gross  
He's just... That's right. And you know, he's a better person for it, maybe.

[@35:59](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2159.73) \- Joe Amditis  
Oh. Hopefully. We'll see. But yeah. Okay. Let's see. So that's, I think that's everything, right? Did we cover?

[@36:09](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2169.13) \- Amy Maestas  
Did we cover? think no.

[@36:11](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2171.15) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay. Let me see here. I'm going to take, I cannot believe, during this time while we've been talking, like I said, I've been collecting screenshots of all the, just the most recent giving news emails.  
And look how many I have on this thing already. Just from, just while we were talking just now, I have so many.  
SCREEN SHARING: Joe started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2207.60981)  
Wait, almost there. Look at this. Where are we? And I just had to remove one. These are just in the recent emails.

[@36:53](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2213.35) \- Liza Gross  
Wow.

[@36:58](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2218.73) \- Joe Amditis  
There we go. go. That's so many. All right. All right. Anything else that we need?

[@37:08](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2228.81) \- Liza Gross  
Okay. Here's a bingo game that we could play, which, you know, this has given me the idea. We put bingo, the bingo card is random photographs of the 10, you know, of the 10, 9, because one was online.  
Summits, right? Or nine or eight summits that we've had. And we have several posters of this. And then the one who can identify or the group or the team that can identify this first wins.  
But now we need to think of an award. And we can do this maybe in the reception or something like that as an icebreaker.  
But, you know, we... can create the bingo cards with six photographs, six random photographs, and then you can choose a team, and then the team that, you know, we can do like 10 of these, because it's the 10th anniversary.  
And so if we have teams of six or seven people, that's practically 50% of the people that are attending.  
So the one that fills out or identifies all of the photographs first wins, and we need to have a prize.

[@38:33](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2313.37) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay.

[@38:36](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2316.67) \- Liza Gross  
But here is one thing that we can do that's fun. I am just thinking of fun stuff. Is it, I mean, did I make myself clear when I am trying to explain this?

[@38:47](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2327.43) \- Joe Amditis  
So this is a game just for us, or is this going to be at the summit?

[@38:50](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2330.37) \- Liza Gross  
At the summit, for the summit. So we create 10 posters with six or seven random pictures. of the, you know, the various, the various summits.  
And then people can sign up for a team to be in a team. And then we let them loose.  
You choose a poster board and see if you can identify. I'm the first team to identify all of the pictures.  
I mean, we can make some really easy, like the Hancock building. It can be one of the pictures. So obviously, that was the Chicago summit.  
But we can make a couple just, you know, people standing or a group of people standing, a panelist or something like that.  
And it shouldn't be too difficult to find eight or nine representative photographs and the one who can identify all of them.  
But then we need to think about a price.

[@39:50](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2390.43) \- Joe Amditis  
Okay. I like that.

[@39:54](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2394.13) \- Liza Gross  
For the, for So it can be like a, you know. It can be like our headphones because that would only help one person.

[@40:05](https://fathom.video/share/PH6Lz5-1N8JP6AiujiXTPCJignbGaPuL?timestamp=2405.75) \- Amy Maestas  
I mean, what if we did something like a coaching session? You know, more, I mean, we could give an item, which is difficult to give an item to a whole team.  
But, I don't know, some sort of one-hour coaching session with Blue Engine.

I'm just throwing things out there, kind of a thing, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That could be, and depending on the size of the team, maybe we can come up with, because the teams may be, you know, you and Teresa Afrontado, for example, who are not in the same geographical space and do not work for the same organization.  
So, they could be your friend, but not necessarily someone who is on the same professional trajectory as you are.  
But they all be in collaboration. So, maybe. That you know, that could be, if the teams are 10 people, we could do a free hour of coaching or something like that for each of the organizations that these people belong to.  
That could be, anyway, just put the bee in the bonnet and another thing for the hopper, Joe.
