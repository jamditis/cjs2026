## Writing style guidelines

All content follows these principles (per CLAUDE.md):

- **Direct, warm, professional tone** — no hype words
- **Community-focused language** — "we've built," "together"
- **Sentence case headlines** — not title case
- **"CJS2026" is one word** — no space between CJS and 2026
- **Let accomplishments speak for themselves** — 1,500 attendees, 7 cities, 10 years
- **Minimal emoji** — professional restraint
