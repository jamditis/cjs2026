### What attendees are saying

We asked past CJS attendees what keeps them coming back. Here's what they told us:

> "The connections I made at CJS turned into real partnerships. Three of my newsroom's current collaborative projects started with conversations at the summit."

> "CJS is where I learned that our challenges aren't unique — and that there are people willing to help solve them together."

> "It's the only conference where everyone actually wants to collaborate. You leave with ideas, partners, and energy."
