## Email body

The deadline to pitch a session for CJS2026 is **one week away** — January 31.

If you've been sitting on a session idea, now's the time. We're looking for:

- **Case studies** of collaborative projects (what worked, what didn't)
- **Hands-on workshops** teaching practical skills
- **Problem-solving sessions** tackling shared challenges
- **Lightning talks** sharing quick insights or experiments
- **Panel discussions** exploring big-picture trends

This is our 10th anniversary summit. We want the program to reflect where collaborative journalism has been — and where it's going next.

### What we're especially interested in

- Sessions from practitioners who've never presented at CJS before
- Workshops that help newcomers get started with collaboration
- Honest conversations about what's hard (not just what's working)
- Creative formats beyond traditional panels
- Topics connecting collaboration to sustainability, equity, or innovation

### Session details

**Format options:**
- 15-minute lightning talk
- 30-minute panel or presentation
- 60-minute workshop or deep-dive session
- 90-minute hands-on training

**Pitch deadline:** January 31, 2026
**Notification:** Late February
**Summit dates:** June 8–9, 2026

Remote presenters are welcome. If you can't travel to Pittsburgh but have something valuable to share, pitch it anyway — we'll figure out the format together.

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with.

**P.S.** Not sure if your idea is right for CJS? Pitch it anyway. We'd rather see it than miss it.
