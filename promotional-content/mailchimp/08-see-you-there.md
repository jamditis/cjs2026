### What we've built together

Ten years ago, a small group gathered in Montclair to talk about collaborative journalism. Most of the work was experimental. The models were unproven. The funding was uncertain.

Today, collaboration is a standard newsroom practice. Multi-organization investigations win major awards. Collaborative networks operate in communities across the country. What started as experiments have become ecosystems.

This didn't happen by accident. It happened because people like you chose to work together, share what you learned, and help others do the same.

This summit celebrates that choice — and the community it created.

See you tomorrow morning.
