## Email body

Happy new year.

This is a big one for us. The 2026 Collaborative Journalism Summit marks our 10th anniversary — a full decade of bringing journalists together to learn, partner, and build the collaborative journalism movement.

Since that first summit in Montclair in 2017, we've gathered nearly 1,500 attendees across eight cities. We've watched one-time experiments become established newsroom practices. We've seen informal partnerships turn into lasting networks. We've built something together.

**This June in Pittsburgh, we're celebrating how far we've come — and where we're headed next.**

### What you need to know right now

**When:** June 8–9, 2026
**Where:** Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (venue TBD)
**Co-located with:** INN Days (June 9–11)
**Theme:** From experiment to ecosystem

### Session pitches due January 31

If you have a session idea — a case study, a workshop, a problem you're trying to solve — we want to hear it. Lightning talks, panels, hands-on sessions, and unconference-style discussions are all welcome.

**Pitch your session:** [PITCH_FORM_LINK]

We'll announce the program in late February and open registration in March.

### What to expect this year

- Keynote sessions exploring a decade of collaborative journalism
- Workshops for both newcomers and experienced collaborators
- Networking with 130–150 practitioners, funders, and researchers
- A special evening celebration to mark ten years together
- Co-location with INN Days for extended learning and community building

This summit has always been about the community we build together. We're grateful you're part of it.

See you in Pittsburgh.
