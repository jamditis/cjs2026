The best sessions at the Collaborative Journalism Summit don't come from a program committee sitting in a conference room. They come from practitioners in newsrooms who have figured something out, tried something new, failed at something instructive, or asked a question that needs collective problem-solving.

For CJS2026 in Chapel Hill this June, we're opening our session pitch process. We want to hear from you.

## What We're Looking For

Our theme this year — "From experiment to ecosystem" — reflects how collaborative journalism has matured over the past decade. We're looking for sessions that honor that evolution while pushing the practice forward.

**Strong pitches will:**

- Share specific, practical lessons from real collaborations
- Address challenges that collaborative journalists face right now
- Offer frameworks or tools that others can adapt
- Spark meaningful discussion and problem-solving
- Include diverse perspectives and experiences
- Go beyond the "why" of collaboration to the "how"

**We're especially interested in sessions about:**

- Measuring impact across multiple newsrooms and platforms
- Building sustainable business models for collaborative work
- Using AI and emerging technologies in collaborative projects
- Making collaboration more inclusive and representative
- Navigating editorial independence in partnership structures
- Training and managing collaborative teams
- Sharing data and sources securely
- Scaling successful pilots into sustained programs
- Rural and small-market collaborative journalism
- Solutions journalism approaches in collaborative contexts
- Legal and ethical considerations in multi-newsroom projects
- Engaging communities in collaborative reporting

## Session Formats

We're accepting pitches for several session formats:

**Workshop sessions (75 minutes):** Interactive, hands-on sessions where participants leave with practical skills or tools. These might include template sharing, collaborative exercises, or skill-building activities.

**Panel discussions (60 minutes):** Focused conversations featuring multiple perspectives on a specific topic. The best panels include practitioners from different types of newsrooms or different roles in the collaboration process.

**Case studies (45 minutes):** Deep dives into specific collaborations — what worked, what didn't, and what others can learn. These should go beyond surface-level success stories to examine real challenges and solutions.

**Lightning talks (15 minutes):** Quick-hit presentations of a single idea, tool, or lesson. Perfect for sharing a specific innovation or insight without needing a full session.

**Problem-solving sessions (60 minutes):** Facilitated discussions where participants help tackle a specific challenge facing collaborative journalism. These are less about presentation and more about collective brainstorming.

## Who Should Pitch

You don't need to be a "collaboration expert" to propose a session. We're looking for:

- Reporters and editors who have worked on collaborative projects
- Newsroom leaders managing collaborative partnerships
- Project managers and coordinators keeping collaborations running
- Data journalists sharing information across newsrooms
- Engagement professionals building collaborative community connections
- Legal and business staff navigating collaboration agreements
- Technologists building tools for collaborative work
- Researchers studying collaborative journalism effectiveness
- Funders supporting collaborative projects
- Educators teaching collaborative journalism

First-time summit attendees are encouraged to pitch. Early-career journalists are encouraged to pitch. If you have something to share that would help others do collaborative journalism better, we want to hear from you.

## What Makes a Strong Pitch

The strongest pitches are specific and actionable. Instead of "How to do collaborative journalism," think "How we used a shared Slack workspace and weekly standups to coordinate 12 newsrooms covering the state legislature."

Instead of "Why collaboration matters," think "What we learned from a failed collaboration that helped us build a successful one."

Tell us:
- What specific topic or question your session addresses
- What format you're proposing and why it fits your topic
- Who should attend and what they'll take away
- Who will lead/facilitate (names, newsrooms, roles)
- Why this session matters for collaborative journalism right now

## What Happens After You Pitch

Our program committee reviews all pitches and makes selections based on:
- Relevance to collaborative journalism practitioners
- Diversity of topics, perspectives, and voices
- Quality and clarity of the pitch
- Mix of session formats and experience levels
- Alignment with this year's theme

Selected presenters receive complimentary summit registration. We'll also work with you to refine your session to make it as useful as possible for attendees.

Even if your pitch isn't selected for a formal session, we may invite you to participate in other ways — as a panelist, a lightning talk presenter, or a facilitator for discussion groups.

## The Pitch Process

**Submit your pitch at:** summit.collaborativejournalism.org/pitch

**Deadline:** [Date TBD - typically 8-10 weeks before summit]

**Notification:** [Date TBD - typically 4-6 weeks before summit]

## Why Your Voice Matters

CJS has always been built on the principle that the best learning happens when practitioners share with each other. The sessions that people remember years later aren't the ones with the slickest presentations — they're the ones where someone shared something real, something useful, something that helped others do better work.

Your collaboration — even if it's small, even if it had challenges, even if it's still in progress — has lessons that others need to hear.

We've spent ten years building a community of collaborative journalists. Now we're inviting you to help shape what the next decade looks like.

Pitch a session. Share what you know. Help us make CJS2026 in Chapel Hill a summit that moves this work forward.
