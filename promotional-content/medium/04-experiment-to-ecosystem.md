# From Experiment to Ecosystem: The Theme Behind CJS2026

Ten years ago, collaborative journalism was still trying to prove itself. Newsrooms that worked together on projects often felt they were doing something experimental — exciting, maybe a little risky, and definitely outside the norm.

Today, collaboration is woven into how many newsrooms operate. It's not a special project or a one-time experiment. It's part of the ecosystem.

That evolution — from experiment to ecosystem — is the theme for CJS2026 in Chapel Hill. Understanding that journey helps us see where collaborative journalism needs to go next.

## What "Experiment" Meant

In the early days of collaborative journalism, even the basics were uncertain:

How do you split bylines fairly? Who owns the story? What if one newsroom wants to publish before the others are ready? How do you share sensitive sources? What happens if newsrooms disagree on editorial direction? Can you really trust a competitor?

These weren't abstract questions. They were practical problems that newsrooms had to solve project by project, often without clear precedents or established best practices.

Collaborations happened anyway, driven by necessity and possibility. Major investigations required resources no single newsroom could muster. Coverage gaps in communities demanded coordinated efforts. Journalists saw that working together could produce better journalism than working alone.

But it still felt experimental. Collaborations were often one-off projects with custom agreements. Newsrooms couldn't be sure what they were getting into. Funders treated collaborative journalism as an innovation to pilot rather than a practice to sustain.

The question underlying everything: Would this actually work?

## The Shift to System-Building

Somewhere along the way — not all at once, but gradually — the question changed.

Not "Does collaboration work?" but "How do we make collaboration work better?"

This shift marked the move from experiment to system. Newsrooms started developing:

**Standard agreements and MOUs** that could be adapted for different partnerships instead of created from scratch each time.

**Editorial protocols** that clarified decision-making, established workflow norms, and resolved common friction points before they became problems.

**Data-sharing practices** with clear rules about attribution, access, and security.

**Communication infrastructure** — Slack channels, project management tools, regular check-ins — that became standard parts of collaborative work.

**Training programs** that taught collaboration skills alongside traditional journalism skills.

The pioneers of collaborative journalism had to figure everything out as they went. The next generation inherited frameworks they could build on.

## What "Ecosystem" Means

An ecosystem is more than just widespread practice. It's an environment where all the pieces reinforce each other:

**Infrastructure** exists to support collaborative work. Organizations like the Center for Cooperative Media, academic programs, and journalism associations provide training, research, and resources specifically for collaboration.

**Funding mechanisms** have evolved. While early collaborations scrambled for one-time grants, now there are programs designed to support sustained collaborative work. Funders understand collaboration's value proposition and build it into their strategies.

**Career paths** recognize collaborative expertise. Project managers, collaboration coordinators, and cross-newsroom roles that didn't exist ten years ago are now established positions.

**Educational programs** prepare students for collaborative work. Journalism schools teach collaboration as a core competency, not an elective or specialty.

**Professional networks** connect collaborative journalists. Through summits like CJS, working groups, and ongoing communities of practice, people doing this work can learn from each other continuously.

**Success stories** provide proof of concept. Major investigations, Pulitzer Prize-winning projects, and sustainable local collaborations demonstrate what's possible.

**Second-generation collaborations** build on what came before. New partnerships don't start from zero — they adapt existing models and learn from documented cases.

This is what an ecosystem looks like: not just individual collaborations succeeding, but an entire environment that makes collaboration more likely to succeed.

## What Hasn't Changed

Even as collaborative journalism has matured, certain challenges persist:

Trust still takes time to build. Editorial independence still requires careful navigation. Business models for collaborative work are still evolving. Power imbalances between large and small newsrooms still create tension. Measuring impact across multiple newsrooms remains complex.

The ecosystem doesn't solve every problem. But it provides more tools, more models, and more support for solving them.

## What Comes Next

If the first decade of CJS was about proving that collaborative journalism works and building the initial infrastructure, the next decade is about deepening and expanding the ecosystem.

That means:

**Inclusivity:** Making sure collaborative journalism includes diverse voices, serves diverse communities, and creates opportunities for newsrooms of all sizes and types.

**Sustainability:** Moving beyond grant-dependent models to build collaborations that can sustain themselves long-term.

**Innovation:** Exploring how emerging technologies — AI, new platforms, evolving distribution methods — can enhance collaborative work.

**Scale:** Growing collaborative practices in regions and communities where they're still emerging.

**Evaluation:** Getting better at measuring what collaboration achieves and communicating that value.

**Training:** Ensuring the next generation of journalists has the skills and mindset for collaborative work.

An ecosystem isn't static. It evolves, adapts, and grows. The question for CJS2026 is: How do we tend this ecosystem so it continues to serve journalism and communities well?

## Why This Theme Matters Now

Understanding where we are — in an ecosystem, not an experiment — changes how we approach collaborative journalism.

It means we can be more ambitious because we're not starting from scratch. It means we can be more critical because we have enough examples to evaluate what works and what doesn't. It means we can be more strategic about building toward a sustainable future.

It also means we have a responsibility to maintain and improve the ecosystem. The infrastructure that supports collaborative journalism needs continued investment. The knowledge base needs to be documented and shared. The community needs to stay connected and supportive.

## Join the Conversation

At CJS2026 in Chapel Hill this June, we'll explore what "from experiment to ecosystem" means in practice. We'll celebrate how far collaborative journalism has come. We'll examine what the ecosystem still needs. And we'll chart the path forward together.

Because that's what an ecosystem does: it supports all of us doing this work, and all of us have a role in strengthening it.
