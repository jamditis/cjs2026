Registration for the 10th anniversary Collaborative Journalism Summit is opening soon, and if you're wondering whether CJS2026 is worth the time and travel, here are seven reasons why this year's gathering in Chapel Hill should be on your calendar.

## 1. Learn From Real Projects, Not Theory

The value of CJS has always been its practitioner focus. Sessions aren't led by consultants selling methodologies or academics presenting research (though we love our researcher friends). They're led by people who have actually done collaborative journalism — the reporters who coordinated coverage across multiple newsrooms, the editors who navigated conflicting publication schedules, the project managers who kept partnerships running.

You'll hear about what worked and, just as importantly, what didn't. You'll get specific, actionable insights you can take back to your newsroom. You'll learn from others' mistakes so you don't have to make them yourself.

Previous attendees consistently say the practical, real-world focus is what makes CJS valuable. You leave with tools, templates, and tactics you can use immediately.

## 2. Build Your Network of Collaborative Journalism Colleagues

Some of the most valuable outcomes of CJS happen between sessions. The editor you meet at lunch becomes your partner on a future investigation. The project manager you talk with over coffee shares the MOU template that saves you weeks of work. The reporter struggling with the same challenges becomes an ongoing sounding board.

Over 1,500 people have attended CJS over the past decade. Many of them will be in Chapel Hill. Whether you're looking for potential partners, seeking advice on a current collaboration, or just want to connect with others doing this work, CJS provides two days of concentrated networking with people who understand collaborative journalism.

And because we cap attendance to keep the event manageable, you can actually have meaningful conversations instead of just collecting business cards.

## 3. Get Current on What's Working Now

Collaborative journalism evolves quickly. Tools change. Platforms shift. New challenges emerge. What worked three years ago might need updating.

CJS2026 will feature sessions on the current state of collaborative journalism:

- How newsrooms are using AI in collaborative projects
- New approaches to measuring impact across partners
- Emerging business models that support sustained collaboration
- Tools and platforms making coordination easier
- Innovations in data journalism partnerships
- Fresh approaches to community engagement in collaborative work

Whether you've been doing collaborative journalism for years or you're just getting started, you'll learn about the latest developments and where the field is heading.

## 4. Solve Problems Together

Some of the most valuable CJS sessions aren't presentations — they're facilitated discussions where participants help each other work through challenges.

Struggling to get organizational buy-in for collaboration? Others have faced that and can share what worked. Trying to figure out how to measure a multi-newsroom project's impact? Let's brainstorm approaches together. Navigating a collaboration that's hit a rough patch? Experienced practitioners can offer perspective and solutions.

The collective knowledge in the room at CJS is substantial. The summit creates structured opportunities to tap into it.

## 5. See the Southeast's Collaborative Journalism Innovations

This is CJS's first time in the Southeast, and that's significant. The region has been building impressive collaborative journalism initiatives that don't always get national attention.

You'll learn from Southeast collaborations that are:
- Serving rural communities where traditional newsroom models no longer work
- Coordinating statewide coverage networks
- Building metro-area partnerships that reach underserved communities
- Creating sustainable models in markets without deep philanthropic infrastructure
- Addressing regional issues that cross state lines

Whether you work in the Southeast or elsewhere, these models offer lessons applicable to your context.

## 6. Mark a Milestone in Collaborative Journalism's Evolution

The 10th anniversary of CJS is more than a calendar marker. It's a chance to reflect on how far collaborative journalism has come and where it needs to go next.

Ten years ago, collaboration was still proving itself. Now it's an established practice with infrastructure, best practices, and a track record of producing impactful journalism.

Being part of CJS2026 means being part of that milestone — acknowledging what's been built and helping shape what comes next.

The summit will include sessions that look both backward and forward: examining collaborative journalism's evolution, identifying what the ecosystem still needs, and charting the path for the next decade.

## 7. Co-Location with INN Days Creates Additional Value

CJS2026 runs June 8-9, immediately followed by INN Days (June 9-11) at the same location. For those who can extend their trip, this co-location offers unique value.

Many successful collaborations involve nonprofit newsrooms. Understanding nonprofit news business models, funding strategies, and operational approaches enhances your ability to build and sustain collaborative partnerships.

The overlap between the collaborative journalism community and the nonprofit news community is significant. Being able to participate in both CJS and INN Days means you can deepen relationships and learning across both events.

Even if you only attend CJS, the co-location means more people will be in Chapel Hill, creating additional networking opportunities.

## The Practical Details

## Making the Case to Your Newsroom

If you need to justify the expense and time away, here's the pitch:

CJS isn't a general journalism conference. It's specifically focused on collaboration, and the return on investment comes through:
- Practical skills and tools you bring back
- Partnerships and relationships that lead to future collaborations
- Solutions to current challenges in your collaborative work
- Understanding of best practices that prevent costly mistakes
- Professional development in an increasingly important area of journalism

For newsrooms already doing collaborative work, CJS helps you do it better. For newsrooms considering collaboration, CJS provides the knowledge and connections to get started effectively.

## Join Us in Chapel Hill

The Collaborative Journalism Summit has spent ten years building a community of practitioners committed to proving that journalism is stronger together. That community will gather in Chapel Hill this June to learn, connect, and push this work forward.

We hope you'll be part of it.
