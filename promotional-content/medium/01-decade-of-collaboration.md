In 2017, a small group of journalists, editors, and newsroom leaders gathered in Montclair, New Jersey, for the first Collaborative Journalism Summit. The idea was simple but ambitious: bring together people who believed that journalism could be stronger when newsrooms worked together instead of competing for every story.

That first gathering proved something important. Collaborative journalism wasn't just a nice idea or a temporary response to shrinking resources. It was a fundamental shift in how journalism could work.

Now, as we prepare for the 10th anniversary of CJS in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on June 8-9, 2026, we're celebrating more than a decade of gatherings. We're marking the evolution of collaborative journalism from an experiment to an established ecosystem.

## The Evolution from Experiment to Ecosystem

The theme for CJS2026 — "From experiment to ecosystem" — reflects how far we've come. In those early years, collaborative journalism felt risky. Newsrooms were trying to figure out how to share sources, split bylines, and coordinate coverage while maintaining their editorial independence and competitive edge.

Fast forward to today, and collaborative journalism is embedded in how many newsrooms operate. Major investigations routinely involve dozens of newsrooms working together. Local news collaboratives have formed in communities across the country. Funders have created programs specifically to support collaborative work. Journalism schools teach collaboration as a core competency.

Over ten summits in seven cities, more than 1,500 attendees have gathered to share what works, troubleshoot what doesn't, and push the practice forward. We've weathered pandemic pivots (2020 and 2021, we're looking at you), explored partnerships with purpose, and focused on building frameworks that last.

## What We've Learned Along the Way

Through a decade of summits, certain truths have emerged:

**People over projects.** The 2019 summit in Philadelphia centered this theme, and it remains core to successful collaboration. The relationships built at CJS have sparked countless partnerships. The trust developed in workshop sessions has translated into newsroom collaborations.

**Local matters.** From Detroit's focus on local journalism to Chicago's emphasis on building to last, we've learned that while national collaborations get headlines, local and regional partnerships often create the most sustainable impact.

**Frameworks are essential.** Early collaborations often succeeded despite structural challenges. Now, we're building systems — MOUs, data-sharing agreements, editorial protocols — that make collaboration smoother and more sustainable.

**Diversity strengthens the work.** The most effective collaborations bring together newsrooms of different sizes, business models, and communities. They include voices that haven't traditionally been in the room.

## Looking Ahead to Pittsburgh

For this 10th anniversary summit, we're heading to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — a city that embodies collaborative spirit and innovation. [Venue TBD] provides the setting for our gathering, and we're exploring opportunities for connection and learning across the journalism community.

We're planning sessions that honor where we've been while pushing forward. Expect conversations about:

- How AI and emerging technologies are changing collaborative journalism
- Building sustainable business models for collaborative work
- Measuring impact across multiple newsrooms
- Making collaboration more inclusive and representative
- Training the next generation of collaborative journalists

## The Summit That Started It All

Ten years ago in Montclair, we weren't sure if collaborative journalism would scale. We didn't know if the movement would last beyond a few high-profile projects. We couldn't predict a pandemic that would force even more innovation in how journalists work together.

But we believed that journalism was stronger when we worked together. We believed that sharing resources, expertise, and stories could serve communities better than going it alone.

A decade later, those beliefs have been proven right over and over. The experiment has grown into an ecosystem. And that ecosystem needs tending, growing, and evolving.

## Prepare to Partner

This year's tagline — "Prepare to partner" — is both an invitation and a challenge. Whether you're a collaboration veteran or just curious about how to start, CJS2026 offers a chance to learn, connect, and push this work forward.

We've spent ten years proving that journalism is stronger together. Now it's time to build on that foundation for the next decade.

Join us in Pittsburgh this June. Let's celebrate how far we've come and chart where we're going next.
