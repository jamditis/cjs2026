As we build the program for CJS2026 in Chapel Hill this June, we wanted to give you an early look at the themes, topics, and session formats taking shape. While the full schedule won't be finalized until session pitches are reviewed, here's what you can expect from the 10th anniversary summit.

## Opening: The Ecosystem We've Built

We're opening CJS2026 with a reflection on collaborative journalism's journey from experiment to ecosystem. Over the past decade, we've built infrastructure, established best practices, created funding mechanisms, and proven that collaboration works.

But an ecosystem isn't static. It needs tending, evolving, and expanding. The opening session will set the stage for two days of examining what the collaborative journalism ecosystem has achieved and what it still needs.

Expect a mix of storytelling, data on collaboration's growth, and a look ahead at emerging opportunities and challenges.

## Track One: Making Collaboration Sustainable

One of the biggest questions facing collaborative journalism: How do we move beyond grant-dependent, project-based work to build collaborations that sustain themselves?

Sessions in this track will explore:

**Business model innovation** — Membership approaches, sponsorship strategies, and earned revenue models that can support sustained collaborative work.

**Organizational structures** — Legal entities, fiscal sponsorship, and partnership agreements that provide stable foundations for ongoing collaboration.

**Efficiency and scale** — Tools, processes, and systems that make collaboration less resource-intensive over time.

**Measuring and communicating value** — Demonstrating impact to funders, newsroom leadership, and communities in ways that justify sustained investment.

These sessions will feature collaborations that have moved from startup phase to sustained operations, as well as honest discussions about what hasn't worked.

## Track Two: Deepening Impact and Quality

Sustainability matters, but not if the journalism isn't excellent. This track focuses on making collaborative projects more impactful and higher quality.

Expect sessions on:

**Investigations** — Coordinating complex investigative work across multiple newsrooms, managing sensitive sources, and navigating legal considerations.

**Data journalism** — Sharing datasets securely, standardizing data collection across partners, and collaborating on analysis.

**Solutions journalism** — Collaborative approaches to solutions reporting, community engagement in defining problems and solutions, and measuring solutions journalism impact.

**Audience impact** — Reaching broader and more diverse audiences through collaboration, measuring engagement across platforms and newsrooms, and understanding what collaborative journalism achieves for communities.

## Track Three: Technology and Tools

The tools available for collaborative journalism have evolved significantly. This track explores how technology can enhance collaborative work.

Topics include:

**AI in collaborative journalism** — Using AI tools for transcription, research, and analysis in multi-newsroom projects. Where AI helps and where human coordination remains essential.

**Collaboration platforms** — What's working in project management tools, communication platforms, and shared workspaces. Real talk about what newsrooms actually use versus what sounds good in theory.

**Data security** — Protecting sources and sensitive information when multiple newsrooms are involved. Encryption, secure sharing, and risk management.

**Distribution and publishing** — Coordinating publication across different platforms and CMSs, managing embargos, and maximizing reach through strategic distribution.

## Track Four: Inclusion and Representation

Making collaborative journalism more inclusive — in who participates, whose voices are centered, and which communities are served — is essential to the ecosystem's health.

Sessions will address:

**Power dynamics** — Navigating relationships between large and small newsrooms, legacy and startup organizations, well-funded and under-resourced partners.

**Community engagement** — Involving communities in collaborative reporting, building trust, and ensuring work serves community needs.

**Rural and underserved markets** — Collaborative models that work in areas where traditional newsroom structures have collapsed or never existed.

**Diverse voices** — Building collaborations that include diverse perspectives and serve diverse communities.

## Workshops and Skill-Building

Beyond panel discussions and case studies, CJS2026 will include hands-on workshops:

- Template sharing: MOUs, editorial agreements, and partnership structures you can adapt
- Facilitation skills: How to manage multi-newsroom meetings and decision-making
- Conflict navigation: Addressing common friction points in partnerships
- Pitch development: Turning collaboration ideas into fundable proposals
- Project management: Practical tools for keeping collaborative projects on track

These sessions are designed for learning by doing, not just listening.

## Lightning Talks and Innovation Showcase

Some of the best ideas don't need an hour-long session. Our lightning talk sessions give people 15 minutes to share a specific tool, lesson, or innovation.

Past lightning talks have introduced everything from Slack workflows to contract templates to novel approaches for coordinating publication. They're fast-paced, practical, and often spark ideas you can implement immediately.

## Networking and Informal Learning

The formal schedule is just part of what makes CJS valuable. We're building in time for:

- Structured networking sessions where you can connect with others working in your region, covering similar beats, or facing similar challenges
- Problem-solving clinics where you can get input on specific issues you're facing
- Meals designed to facilitate conversation
- Evening gatherings that extend discussions and deepen relationships

Some of the most valuable connections and insights happen in the margins.

## Special 10th Anniversary Programming

Because this is CJS's 10th anniversary, we're including special programming:

- Conversations with pioneers who launched early collaborations
- A look at collaborations that have sustained themselves for years
- Reflections on lessons learned from collaborations that didn't work out
- A forward-looking discussion on collaborative journalism's next decade

## Regional Focus: Southeast Collaborations

Taking advantage of our Chapel Hill location, we'll highlight Southeast collaborative journalism initiatives and the lessons they offer.

From statewide networks to metro-area partnerships to cross-border collaborations, the Southeast is producing models worth learning from. Sessions will feature these collaborations and explore what makes them work.

## What's Still Taking Shape

While these tracks and themes are set, the specific sessions are still being finalized. The session pitch process (now open at summit.collaborativejournalism.org/pitch) will determine many of the case studies, panels, and workshops.

This means the schedule reflects what the collaborative journalism community needs right now, not what a program committee decided six months ago.
