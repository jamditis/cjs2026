For nine years, the Collaborative Journalism Summit has traveled across the country — from Montclair to Philadelphia, Chicago to Detroit, Washington DC to Denver. Each location has been chosen intentionally, connecting the summit to communities where collaborative journalism is thriving.

~~For our 10th anniversary, we're heading to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and the UNC Friday Center. Here's why the Southeast is the perfect place to mark this milestone.~~ **OUTDATED - Pittsburgh, PA is the new location.**

## A Region Leading in Collaborative Innovation

The Southeast has become a laboratory for collaborative journalism innovation. Across the region, newsrooms are building partnerships that address the challenges facing local news while creating models others can learn from.

North Carolina itself hosts several notable collaborations. The NC Local News Lab Fund supports collaborative projects across the state. The NC News Collaborative has connected newsrooms to cover statewide issues. Local efforts like the Charlotte Journalism Collaborative demonstrate how metro-area partnerships can fill coverage gaps and reach new audiences.

Beyond North Carolina, the Southeast showcases the range of what's possible. The Mississippi Today network has built a statewide collaborative reporting system. Georgia newsrooms have partnered on investigations and community coverage. Virginia and Tennessee have seen growth in solutions-focused collaborations.

These aren't just experiments anymore — they're sustainable operations proving that collaborative journalism can thrive in markets of all sizes.

## The UNC Connection

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has been a key player in supporting and studying collaborative journalism. The UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media has produced research on collaboration effectiveness, trained students in collaborative practices, and supported newsrooms attempting this work.

The UNC Friday Center, our summit venue, provides an ideal setting for the kind of intensive workshops and networking that make CJS valuable. Located just outside Chapel Hill, it offers the space and resources we need while keeping us connected to a community deeply engaged with journalism's future.

## Filling a Geographic Gap

For all our travel over the past decade, CJS hasn't spent enough time in the Southeast. By bringing the summit to Chapel Hill, we're able to include voices and perspectives that have sometimes been underrepresented in national journalism conversations.

The Southeast faces unique challenges: rural news deserts, rapidly growing metro areas straining local news capacity, states with limited philanthropic infrastructure for journalism, and communities navigating complex demographic shifts. But the region is also producing unique solutions worth learning from and replicating.

Holding CJS2026 in Chapel Hill makes it easier for Southeast journalists, editors, and newsroom leaders to participate. It reduces travel costs and time away from the newsroom. And it signals that collaborative journalism isn't just happening in traditional media hubs — it's thriving in communities across the country.

## Co-Location with INN Days

An added benefit of Chapel Hill: we're co-locating with INN Days, which runs June 9-11, immediately following CJS. For nonprofit news organizations and those interested in that sector, this creates a unique opportunity to participate in both events, learning from collaborative journalism practitioners and then diving deep into nonprofit news business models and strategies.

This co-location recognizes that many of the most innovative collaborations involve nonprofit newsrooms, and that the collaborative journalism ecosystem and nonprofit news ecosystem are increasingly intertwined.

## The Southeast's Collaborative Journalism Landscape

Part of what makes the Southeast compelling right now is the diversity of its collaborative journalism models:

**Statewide networks** like Mississippi Today are demonstrating how a hub newsroom can support and amplify local coverage across an entire state.

**Metro collaboratives** in cities like Charlotte are showing how multiple newsrooms can coordinate to cover underserved communities and topics.

**Solutions-focused partnerships** are tackling issues like education, health care, and economic development through collaborative reporting that emphasizes problem-solving.

**Rural collaborations** are testing how to sustain journalism in areas where a single newsroom may no longer be viable.

**Cross-border partnerships** are forming to cover regional issues that don't respect state lines.

Each of these models has lessons for journalists working in other regions and contexts.

## What This Means for the Summit

Holding CJS2026 in Chapel Hill will shape the summit's content and conversations. Expect sessions that highlight Southeast collaborations and the lessons they offer. Expect discussions about the particular challenges of rural collaborative journalism. Expect to meet newsroom leaders who are building sustainable partnerships in markets that don't fit the traditional coastal-city model.

And expect to experience Southern hospitality as we mark ten years of gathering to push collaborative journalism forward.

## Looking Ahead

As we prepare for our 10th anniversary summit, the choice of Chapel Hill reflects our commitment to meeting collaborative journalists where they are — not just geographically, but in their work. The Southeast isn't just hosting CJS2026; it's helping shape what this milestone event will be.

If you're working in or curious about collaborative journalism, Chapel Hill is where you need to be this June.

**Save the date: June 8-9, 2026 at the UNC Friday Center in Chapel Hill, NC. Registration information coming soon at summit.collaborativejournalism.org.**
