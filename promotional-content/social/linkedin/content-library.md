## POST 1: 10th Anniversary Announcement

**Post Text:**
Ten years ago, a small group of journalists gathered in Montclair, NJ with a bold idea: what if collaboration, not competition, was the future of journalism?

That experiment became the Collaborative Journalism Summit. And in 2026, we're celebrating a decade of turning that experiment into an ecosystem.

Join us June 8-9, 2026 in Chapel Hill, NC for CJS2026—our 10th anniversary summit. We've moved from asking "can we collaborate?" to "how do we scale what works?"

If you're building partnerships, sharing resources, or reimagining what local news can be, this is your community.

## POST 2: Session Pitch Call - Thought Leadership

**Post Text:**
The best conference sessions don't come from the organizers—they come from the field.

We're looking for practitioners to share what's actually working in collaborative journalism. Not theory. Not wishful thinking. Real projects, real challenges, real outcomes.

What have you learned from your partnerships in the past year? What failed? What surprised you? What would you do differently?

If you've been in the trenches of collaborative work, we want to hear from you. Session proposals for CJS2026 are open.

This is how we learn from each other. This is how the field moves forward.

## POST 3: Why Chapel Hill / Southeast Journalism

**Post Text:**
There's a reason we're bringing CJS2026 to Chapel Hill.

The Southeast is where some of the most innovative collaborative journalism is happening right now. From the Mississippi Today network to Resolve Philly's expansion south, from rural news collaboratives to university-newsroom partnerships—this region is writing the playbook.

Chapel Hill sits at the heart of it: home to UNC's Reese News Lab, Cardinal & Pine, NC Local News Lab Collaborative, and a journalism school that's training the next generation to think collaboration-first.

The location isn't just convenient. It's strategic. It's where the work is happening.

## POST 4: Registration Launch

Here's what you're getting:
• Two days of sessions led by practitioners, not consultants
• Direct access to the people doing collaborative journalism at scale
• Structured networking with 130-150 peers who get it

## POST 5: What Is Collaborative Journalism in 2026?

**Post Text:**
In 2017, we were explaining what collaborative journalism meant.

In 2026, we're talking about how to do it better.

Collaboration isn't experimental anymore. It's infrastructure. News organizations are sharing reporters, pooling investigations, co-publishing across states, building technology together, and creating new revenue models as collectives.

But scaling collaboration comes with new challenges: How do we maintain editorial independence? How do we fund shared roles? How do we build trust across different organizational cultures? How do we measure impact when credit is distributed?

CJS2026 is where we tackle these questions together. Where we move from pilots to platforms. From experiments to ecosystems.

Meet [SPEAKER NAME], [TITLE] at [ORGANIZATION].

[He/She/They] led [SPECIFIC COLLABORATIVE PROJECT] that [CONCRETE OUTCOME—e.g., "engaged 12 newsrooms across 3 states" or "reached 2M new readers" or "changed state policy"].

At CJS2026, [SPEAKER NAME] will share:
• What actually worked (and what failed) in building that partnership
• The unglamorous logistics nobody talks about
• How they're scaling what they learned

## POST 7: INN Days Co-Location Benefits

**Post Text:**
Smart scheduling ahead: CJS2026 (June 8-9) is immediately followed by INN Days (June 9-11) at the same venue in Chapel Hill.

If you work in nonprofit news, this is your annual double-header.

June 8-9: Learn collaborative strategies from across the journalism landscape
June 9: Overlap day—connect with both communities
June 10-11: Deep dive into nonprofit news business models and sustainability

Same venue. One trip. Two essential professional development experiences. Make your travel budget work twice as hard.

## POST 8: Professional Development Investment

**Post Text:**
Let's talk about ROI on conference attendance.

CJS2026 costs [PRICE]. Your travel and hotel might add another [ESTIMATE].

Here's what you get for that investment:
• Strategies that help you do more with the same budget (or less)
• Connections to potential partners who can share costs on your next project
• Models for shared positions that stretch your staffing
• Funder insights on what's getting supported in 2026-27
• A peer network you'll tap into for years

The math isn't "cost of attendance." It's "cost of not learning how others are solving the same problems you're facing."

## POST 9: From Experiment to Ecosystem Theme

**Post Text:**
Our theme for CJS2026: "From experiment to ecosystem."

Because collaborative journalism isn't a pilot program anymore. It's how we work.

Ten years ago, cross-newsroom partnerships were novel. Today, they're necessary. The question isn't whether to collaborate—it's how to make collaboration sustainable, scalable, and strategic.

At CJS2026, we're focusing on:
• Building infrastructure that outlasts individual projects
• Creating collaborative cultures, not just collaborative projects
• Developing business models that support shared work
• Scaling what works without losing what makes it work

This is about moving from "let's try this" to "this is how we operate."

## POST 10: Networking Value Proposition

**Post Text:**
The sessions at CJS2026 are valuable. The conversations between sessions are priceless.

This is a working conference. The people in the room are actively doing collaborative journalism—not theorizing about it. They're managing multi-newsroom investigations, building regional networks, negotiating partnership agreements, and figuring out shared funding.

The person you meet at coffee might become your partner on next year's project. The side conversation at lunch might solve a problem you've been stuck on for months.

130-150 practitioners. Two days. Structured networking sessions plus organic connection time.

This is your community. Come find your people.

## POST 11: Mid-Career Professional Angle

**Post Text:**
Mid-career journalists: this one's for you.

You've been in the industry long enough to see what's changing. You're established enough to have credibility. You're positioned to lead—but maybe your organization hasn't caught up to where the field is going.

CJS2026 is where you'll find your next move. Whether that's:
• Bringing collaborative models back to your current newsroom
• Connecting with organizations that are already doing this work
• Understanding how to position yourself for leadership in collaborative structures
• Building the network you'll need for whatever comes next

This is career development disguised as a conference.

## POST 12: Editor's Perspective - Why Send Your Team

**Post Text:**
Editors: here's why you should send someone from your team to CJS2026.

They'll come back with:
1. Specific models for partnerships that could reduce your costs
2. Connections to newsrooms you could collaborate with
3. Understanding of what funders are supporting (and how to position your work)
4. Ideas for shared positions that extend your capacity
5. Strategies others have used to navigate the challenges you're facing

This isn't a luxury. It's reconnaissance. The news industry is reorganizing around collaboration. You need someone in the room who can bring back intelligence on how to navigate that shift.

## POST 13: Funder Perspective - Where the Field Is Going

**Post Text:**
Journalism funders: CJS2026 is where you'll see where your dollars are actually going.

Not pitch decks. Not proposals. Real practitioners sharing what's working in collaborative journalism—and what's not.

You'll hear:
• How newsrooms are using collaborative models to increase impact
• What infrastructure actually costs vs. what gets budgeted
• Where partnerships are succeeding and where they're struggling
• What the field needs next (from the people doing the work)

If you're investing in collaborative journalism, innovation, or local news sustainability, this is your annual field scan.

## POST 14: University Partnership Angle

**Post Text:**
Journalism educators and academic researchers: CJS2026 needs you in the room.

Here's why:
• You're training the next generation—you need to know what collaboration looks like in practice
• Your students need internship/job connections with organizations doing this work
• Practitioner-academic partnerships are driving innovation (Reese News Lab, Medill Local News Initiative, etc.)
• Research on collaborative journalism models informs both teaching and practice

The gap between academia and practice is shrinking in journalism. CJS is where that bridge gets built.

## POST 15: Registration Filling Up

CJS2026 is limited to 150 attendees.

## POST 16: What Makes CJS Different

**Post Text:**
What makes CJS different from other journalism conferences?

1. **Practitioner-led:** Sessions are taught by people actively doing collaborative work, not consultants selling a methodology.

2. **Working conference:** This isn't inspirational TED talks. It's practical strategy sessions with real budgets and real challenges.

3. **Right-sized:** 130-150 people. Big enough for diversity of experience, small enough that you'll actually meet people.

4. **Field-specific:** Everyone in the room is wrestling with collaboration. You're not explaining the basics. You're comparing notes on advanced challenges.

5. **Community, not conference:** The relationships you build here continue long after June.

## POST 17: Freelancer/Independent Journalist Angle

Collaboration isn't just for newsrooms. It's for:
• Freelancers pooling resources for ambitious projects
• Independent journalists finding partners for investigations
• Solo practitioners connecting with outlets for distribution
• Reporters building networks across beats and regions

Some of the most innovative collaborative work is happening outside traditional newsroom structures. You need to be in this conversation.

## POST 20: First-Timer Testimonial

**Post Text:**
"I almost didn't go to my first CJS. I thought it would be too advanced, too insider, too much for someone just starting to think about collaboration.

I was completely wrong.

The community welcomed me. People shared actual budgets, actual contracts, actual failures. I left with three potential partners and a completely different understanding of what's possible.

Two years later, I'm leading a five-newsroom collaborative that wouldn't exist without connections I made at CJS."

• Right-sized for meaningful connection
• Practitioner-led content
• Structured networking alongside organic conversation
