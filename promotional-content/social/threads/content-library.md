### Post 3: Reflection on 10 Years
**Text:**
10 years of CJS.

Started in Montclair in 2017 with a small group of journalists who wanted to stop competing and start collaborating.

Went virtual during COVID. Didn't stop us. The partnerships kept forming.

Chicago. DC. Detroit. Denver.

Now Chapel Hill for the 10th anniversary.

From experiment to ecosystem. That's the journey.

What partnership will you form at CJS2026?

**Timing:** Late January
**Tone:** Reflective, community-focused

---

### Post 4: Why CJS Exists
**Text:**
Honest question: Why does CJS exist?

Because journalism is stronger together. Because small newsrooms can't compete with platforms, but they can collaborate with each other. Because the best stories often require multiple perspectives and resources.

Because every year, attendees tell us CJS changed their journalism practice. They met partners. Launched projects. Found their people.

That's why we keep doing this. See you in Chapel Hill.

**Timing:** Late January
**Engagement:** Invite responses about collaboration challenges

---

## FEBRUARY 2026 - Building Momentum

### Post 5: What Makes CJS Different
**Text:**
CJS2026 isn't a typical journalism conference.

You won't sit through long keynotes. You won't collect vendor swag. You won't listen to panels where you can't ask questions.

You will:
- Work in small groups on actual projects
- Form partnerships that continue after the event
- Learn from practitioners, not consultants
- Leave with action items, not just inspiration

Two days focused on doing collaborative journalism.

Registration opens next month. Are you ready?

**Timing:** Early February

---

### Post 6: Small Newsroom Focus
**Text:**
Small newsrooms and indie journalists: CJS2026 is designed for you.

No corporate media panels. No PR talking points. No "best practices" from outlets with 50-person newsrooms.

Just practical strategies from people running lean operations:
- Revenue models that work at small scale
- Tools you can actually afford
- Partnerships you can actually manage
- Stories you can actually produce

Real talk. Real solutions. Real journalism.

**Timing:** Mid-February
**Tone:** Direct, no-BS

---

### Post 7: Past Attendee Story
**Text:**
"I almost didn't go to CJS 2023. Felt like I couldn't afford the time away from my newsroom. Best professional decision I made that year.

I met two other editors facing the same investigative funding challenges. We co-applied for a grant together. Got it. Published the series six months later.

That partnership is still going."

— Real attendee (name withheld by request)

Stories like this happen every year. What's stopping you from registering for CJS2026?

**Timing:** Late February
**Engagement:** Invite similar stories in replies

---

### Post 8: Registration Opens Soon
**Text:**
Registration for CJS2026 opens in two weeks.

Fair warning: We keep attendance limited. Not as a sales tactic, but because the summit only works when conversations can go deep and everyone can connect.

Last year sold out in three weeks. The year before, two weeks.

Set a reminder. Get your budget approved. Talk to your editor.

June 8-9 in Chapel Hill. Space is limited to 150 attendees.

**Timing:** Two weeks before registration opens

## MARCH 2026 - Registration Opens

### Post 9: Registration Launch
**Text:**
Registration is open for CJS2026.

June 8-9 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Our 10th anniversary summit.

Limited to 150 attendees. Spots filling fast.

Every CJS attendee I've talked to says they wish they'd attended sooner. They wish they'd found this community years ago.

This is your chance. Register at collaborativejournalism.org/cjs2026

**Timing:** Registration opening day (morning)

---

### Post 10: Spots Filling Up
**Text:**
CJS2026 is capped at 150 attendees. Spots are going fast.

I know March budgets are tight. I know it's hard to justify conference costs when you're running a small newsroom.

Here's what past attendees say made it worth it:
- Co-publishing partnerships that reduce costs
- Revenue model ideas that increased sustainability
- Tool recommendations that saved money
- Community that provides ongoing support

The ROI isn't immediate. But it's real.

Don't wait until we're sold out.

**Timing:** Mid-March

---

### Post 11: Who Attends CJS
**Text:**
Who actually attends CJS?

Indie journalists running one-person operations. Small newsroom editors managing 3-person teams. Reporters at legacy outlets trying to innovate. Nonprofit journalism founders. Community-funded experiment leaders. Academic researchers. Funders who get it.

What they have in common: They believe journalism is better when we work together.

If that's you, CJS2026 is for you.

June 8-9 in Chapel Hill. Register at collaborativejournalism.org/cjs2026

**Timing:** Mid-March

---

### Post 12: Chapel Hill Preview
**Text:**
Why Chapel Hill for our 10th anniversary?

It's the perfect size. Walkable downtown. Great food scene. UNC campus nearby. Spaces designed for collaboration.

The UNC Friday Center venue has everything we need: Workshop rooms. Networking spaces. Natural light. Good coffee.

Plus, Chapel Hill has a strong local journalism community that understands collaboration. Felt right for the anniversary.

Can't wait to show you around. June 8-9.

**Timing:** Late March
**Tone:** Warm, inviting

---

## APRIL 2026 - Speaker Announcements

### Post 13: Speaker Announcements Coming
**Text:**
First CJS2026 speaker announcements drop this week.

Expect founders of successful collaborative newsrooms. Editors who've pioneered new revenue models. Reporters doing groundbreaking partnership journalism. Practitioners who've failed and learned from it.

No thought leaders. No consultants who've never run a newsroom. No vendor pitches disguised as sessions.

Just people doing the work. Sharing what works. Admitting what doesn't.

Stay tuned.

**Timing:** Early April (Monday/Tuesday)

---

### Post 14: Speaker Spotlight Template
**Text:**
Speaker spotlight: [Speaker Name]

[Speaker Name] [brief description of their collaborative journalism work and impact - 2-3 sentences].

At CJS2026, [Speaker Name] will lead a session on [topic]. [One sentence about what attendees will learn].

"[Quote from speaker about why collaboration matters or what they hope attendees take away]"

Join us June 8-9 in Chapel Hill.
Register: collaborativejournalism.org/cjs2026

**Timing:** Throughout April (can post 4-5 speaker spotlights)
**Note:** Repeat this template for multiple speakers
**Character count:** Adjust bio and quote to stay under 500 chars

---

### Post 15: Session Preview
**Text:**
Sessions taking shape for CJS2026:

AI tools for collaborative reporting (what works, what's hype)
Revenue sharing models that actually work (with real numbers)
Community-funded journalism experiments (wins and failures)
Cross-newsroom investigations (partnership agreements, workflow)
Sustainability strategies for small newsrooms (beyond grants)

Full schedule drops in May.

This isn't theory. These are practitioners sharing real results.

**Timing:** Late April

---

### Post 16: Why Practitioners, Not Consultants
**Text:**
Every CJS speaker is a practitioner. People currently doing collaborative journalism, not people who used to do it or people who advise others how to do it.

Why? Because the challenges change fast. What worked in 2022 doesn't work in 2026. You need current insights from people in the trenches.

Plus, practitioners give you real numbers, real failures, real partnership agreements, real workflows. Not theory. Not case studies. Real tools you can use Monday.

That's the CJS difference.

**Timing:** Mid-April
**Tone:** Clear positioning

---

## BONUS POSTS - Use Throughout Campaign

### Bonus 1: Addressing Common Objections
**Text:**
"I can't afford to take two days away from my newsroom."

I hear this every year. Here's what past attendees say:

The partnerships you form save you time later. Co-publishing means sharing reporting load. Collaborative investigations mean sharing costs.

The revenue model ideas often pay for the trip within months.

The community provides ongoing support that reduces the isolation of running a small newsroom.

Can you afford NOT to invest in partnerships?

CJS2026: June 8-9. Register at collaborativejournalism.org/cjs2026

**Timing:** Any time during campaign
**Engagement:** Invite responses about barriers to attending

---

### Bonus 2: Collaboration Success Story
**Text:**
Collaboration success story:

In 2022, three CJS attendees from different states met in Chicago. They all covered environmental issues in rural communities.

They formed a co-publishing partnership. Shared reporting resources. Split costs on data analysis tools.

Published a collaborative investigation series in 2023. Won regional awards. Republished by 40+ outlets.

Still partnering today.

This happens every year at CJS. What partnership will you form?

**Timing:** Any time
**Tone:** Concrete, specific example

---

### Bonus 3: Why Chapel Hill
**Text:**
Fun fact: Chapel Hill has a strong tradition of collaborative journalism.

UNC's journalism school has been teaching collaborative reporting for years. Local newsrooms regularly partner on investigations. The community understands that journalism is stronger together.

Felt like the right place to celebrate our 10th anniversary.

Plus: Great food, walkable downtown, beautiful campus, spaces designed for collaboration.

Can't wait to show you around. June 8-9.

**Timing:** March-May
**Tone:** Warm, local flavor

---

### Bonus 4: Behind the Scenes - Planning
**Text:**
Behind the scenes of planning CJS2026:

We're not an events company. We're journalists who believe in collaboration and think the best way to spread that belief is to bring people together.

Every year, we debate: Keep it small or grow bigger? We always choose small. Because the magic happens in intimate conversations, not crowded halls.

We turn down sponsors who want speaking slots. We say no to vendors who want booths.

It's just practitioners sharing what works. That's it. That's CJS.

**Timing:** February-April
**Tone:** Transparent, values-driven

---

### Bonus 5: Addressing Imposter Syndrome
**Text:**
"I'm just a freelancer. Is CJS for me?"
"My newsroom only has two people. Will I fit in?"
"I'm new to collaboration. Should I wait until I have more experience?"

Yes. Yes. And absolutely not.

CJS is for everyone doing journalism, regardless of team size or experience level. Some of the best partnerships form between veterans and newcomers.

You belong here. Register for CJS2026.

**Timing:** March-May
**Engagement:** Invite first-timers to ask questions

---

### Bonus 6: What Collaboration Means
**Text:**
Collaboration in journalism doesn't mean losing your identity or giving up your scoop.

It means:
- Sharing expensive tools and data resources
- Co-publishing to reach wider audiences
- Partnering on investigations too big for one newsroom
- Learning from peers facing similar challenges
- Building sustainability together instead of competing alone

Collaborative journalism is still journalism. Just stronger.

That's what CJS2026 is about.

**Timing:** Any time
**Tone:** Educational, clarifying

---

### Bonus 7: Revenue Models Teaser
**Text:**
Revenue models that will be discussed at CJS2026:

- Membership programs for small newsrooms (real numbers)
- Co-publishing revenue shares (contract templates)
- Community-funded investigations (what works, what doesn't)
- Collaborative grant applications (success rates)
- Shared subscription models (case studies)

Not theory. Real practitioners sharing real results.

June 8-9 in Chapel Hill.

**Timing:** April-May
**Tone:** Practical, specific

---

### Bonus 8: Community Question

## Threads Platform Strategy

### Posting Frequency
- **January-February:** 3-4 posts per week
- **March (registration):** 4-5 posts per week
- **April-May:** 3-4 posts per week
- **June (event week):** Multiple posts daily

### Best Times to Post
- **Weekdays:** 9-11am EST or 1-3pm EST
- **Avoid:** Early morning (before 8am), late night
- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

### Engagement Strategy
- Respond to every reply within 6 hours
- Ask questions to encourage conversation
- Use polls/questions in posts
- Repost attendee content
- Be conversational, not promotional

### Tone Guidelines
**Do:**
- Be direct and honest
- Share real stories and examples
- Admit challenges and failures
- Use conversational language
- Ask questions and invite responses

**Don't:**
- Use hype words or oversell
- Make vague promises
- Sound corporate or promotional
- Use excessive hashtags (Threads displays them differently)
- Copy/paste identical content from other platforms

### Cross-Posting Notes
**From Bluesky to Threads:**
- Most Bluesky posts (300 chars) fit easily in Threads (500 chars)
- Can expand with additional context or examples
- Adjust tone slightly (Threads is bit more professional)

**From Threads to Instagram:**
- Threads text can become Instagram captions
- Add hashtags for Instagram (Threads uses them sparingly)
- Consider visual component for Instagram

**From Threads to LinkedIn:**
- Can expand Threads posts into longer LinkedIn posts
- Make tone more professional/formal
- Add business context or industry insights

### Hashtag Strategy for Threads
- Use sparingly (2-3 max per post)
- Threads displays hashtags in-line, not as a block
- Primary: #CJS2026 #CollaborativeJournalism
- Use topic-specific hashtags when relevant: #JournalismInnovation #SmallNewsrooms

### Character Management
- 500 character limit (vs. 300 on Bluesky)
- Use space for:
  - More context and examples
  - Longer quotes
  - Additional details
  - More conversational tone
- Don't feel need to max out every post

### Community Building
- Threads is good for ongoing conversations
- Use reply threads to go deeper on topics
- Encourage attendees to share their own stories
- Create discussion prompts
- Foster peer-to-peer connections

### Link Strategy
- Include full URLs (Threads doesn't shorten)
- Primary link: collaborativejournalism.org/cjs2026
- Use links sparingly (1 per post max)
- Links don't count against character limit
