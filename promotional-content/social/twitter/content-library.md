**Primary:** #CJS2026 (use on every tweet)
**Secondary:** #CollaborativeJournalism (use on 70% of tweets)
**Event-specific:** Add as relevant

**Avoid:** Overusing hashtags (2-3 max per tweet)

---

### Tagging Strategy

**Tag when relevant:**
- @CenterCoopMedia (host organization)
- Speaker Twitter handles (when announcing sessions)
- Partner organizations (when announcing partnerships)
- News outlets of attendees sharing testimonials

**Don't tag:**
- Random news orgs hoping for retweets
- People/orgs not directly mentioned in the content

---

### Visual Content Notes

**Photo priorities:**
1. Attendees in conversation (candid, authentic)
2. Speakers presenting (professional, dynamic)
3. Venue shots showing space and Pittsburgh
4. Past summit throwback photos for nostalgia

**Graphics needed:**
- Registration announcement graphics
- Countdown graphics (30 days, 2 weeks, 1 week, etc.)
- Session spotlight cards (template with speaker photo, title, key takeaway)
- Stats/impact infographics
- "What to expect" educational graphics
- Mobile app interface previews

**Style notes:**
- Use brand colors (teal, cream, ink from style guide)
- Clean, professional design
- Avoid clip art or generic stock photos
- Authentic over polished

---

## Content Calendar Integration

**Coordinate with:**
- Email newsletter sends (tease on Twitter, detail in email)
- LinkedIn posts (professional angle, same news, different framing)
- Bluesky/Instagram (adapted content for platform norms)
- Blog posts/announcements (Twitter amplifies, links back)

**Tweet timing best practices:**
- Weekday mornings (9-11am ET) for announcements
- Early afternoon (1-3pm ET) for engagement
- Avoid late evenings and weekends for major news
- Event week: Real-time as content happens

## Notes for Social Media Manager

**Tone principles:**
- Direct and clear, not clever for clever's sake
- Warm and welcoming, not corporate or stiff
- Focused on value and community, not hype or sales
- Professional but approachable

**What works:**
- Specific details (names, numbers, concrete takeaways)
- Peer voices (testimonials from attendees/speakers)
- Practical value (what you'll learn, who you'll meet)
- Authentic photos showing real connection

**What to avoid:**
- Excessive exclamation points
- Emoji overload (one per tweet max, if any)
- Vague benefits ("networking opportunities" vs. "meet editors facing your same challenges")
- Stock photos of handshakes or people pointing at laptops

**Engagement approach:**
- Reply to every @mention within 24 hours
- Retweet attendee/speaker content about CJS2026
- Quote tweet with added context rather than bare retweet
- Like replies/mentions even if no response needed
- Monitor #CJS2026 during event and engage in real-time
