## Platform-Specific Notes

**Bluesky Best Practices:**
- Keep it conversational and real
- Journalists respond well to "no BS" tone
- Use threads sparingly - Bluesky favors standalone posts
- Engage in replies - this platform values conversation
- Don't oversell - let the community speak for itself

**Cross-Posting Guidance:**
- Posts 1, 9, 16, 19, 20 work well on all platforms
- Posts 4, 6, 14 are Bluesky-optimized but can adapt for Threads
- Instagram needs visual adaptation for all posts

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- Bluesky uses hashtags less than Twitter
- Stick to #CJS2026 as primary tag
- Add #journalism or #CollabJournalism occasionally
- Don't over-hashtag - it reads as promotional

**Engagement Tips:**
- Share posts from attendees and alumni
- Repost session pitches from community
- Celebrate partnerships that formed at past events
- Highlight small newsrooms and indie journalists
